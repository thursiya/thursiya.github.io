Everywhere.", desc: "<p>Born from the merger of several legacy Korean chaebols during the Great Consolidation of the 2080s, 5-Star Conglomerate quickly rose to become the premier supplier of dependable, mid-tier goods for the expanding interstellar middle class. Built on the industrial DNA of old-world giants, 5-Star's early slogan—<i>&quot;Powering Progress, Planet to Planet&quot;</i>—still defines its mission.</p><p>Specializing in consumer electronics, smart vehicles, and snack foods, 5-Star is best known for its <i>GaonDrive</i> line of autonomous interplanetary vehicles and the ubiquitous NeoLife smart ecosystem, which connects everything from personal devices to home bots to shipboard systems. Though never the flashiest, 5-Star's offerings are prized for their solid engineering, long warranties, and relentless software updates (whether you want them or not).</p><p>The corporation's vertical integration is legendary: from asteroid mining to AI chip design, from consumer drones to deep-space construction equipment, 5-Star does it all under one sprawling umbrella. Its flagship city-sized arcology in orbit over Busan serves as both HQ and living showroom, featuring rotating exhibits of concept vehicles and domestic tech demonstrations for visiting dignitaries.</p><p>Operating in 63 planetary markets and 11 deep-space hubs, 5-Star remains a symbol of East Asian industrial ambition made galactic. It's also a major cultural force, producing branded entertainment, virtual idols, and sponsoring the Interstellar Drift League—a sport made possible by their popular Gaon-7X gravcar.</p>" },

Founded in 2102 during the post-Pandemic Biotech Renaissance, Astromedica emerged from a coalition of Earth-based pharma giants and lunar biotech startups seeking to unify human medical progress under one scalable, space-ready brand.</p><p>Its iconic &quot;A+&quot; logo—often seen glowing on med-bays, cryo-pods, and emergency drones—has become synonymous with survival and trust in the far reaches of colonized space.</p><p>Astromedica's product catalog ranges from gene-tailored antivirals and neural stabilizers to the highly regulated <i>VitalNet™</i>, a subdermal health mesh that monitors and auto-corrects vital signs in real time. The company also pioneered <i>ReGene-X</i>, a controversial regenerative therapy that can reverse cellular aging for approved clients and officials, and its patented <i>NanoClot</i> system has replaced traditional emergency care in over 30 planetary health networks.</p><p>Despite frequent criticism for lobbying, aggressive patent enforcement, and quiet political influence in health governance bodies, Astromedica remains essential to the continued survival of billions. Its orbital R&D platforms orbit ten planets, including Europa, where zero-G conditions allow the cultivation of novel protein structures for next-gen vaccines and cognitive enhancers.</p>" },
