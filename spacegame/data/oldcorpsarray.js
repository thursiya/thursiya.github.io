    <p>Born from the merger of several legacy Korean chaebols during the Great Consolidation of the 2080s, 5-Star Conglomerate quickly rose to become the premier supplier of dependable, mid-tier goods for the 
    expanding interstellar middle class. Built on the industrial DNA of old-world giants, 5-Star's early slogan—<i>"Powering Progress, Planet to Planet"</i>—still defines its mission.</p>
    <p>Specializing in consumer electronics, smart vehicles, and snack foods, 5-Star is best known for its GaonDrive line of autonomous interplanetary vehicles and the ubiquitous NeoLife smart ecosystem, which 
    connects everything from personal devices to home bots to shipboard systems. Though never the flashiest, 5-Star's offerings are prized for their solid engineering, long warranties, and relentless software 
    updates (whether you want them or not).</p>
    <p>The corporation's vertical integration is legendary: from asteroid mining to AI chip design, from consumer drones to deep-space construction equipment, 5-Star does it all under one sprawling umbrella. Its 
    flagship city-sized arcology in orbit over Busan serves as both HQ and living showroom, featuring rotating exhibits of concept vehicles and domestic tech demonstrations for visiting dignitaries.</p>
    <p>Operating in 63 planetary markets and 11 deep-space hubs, 5-Star remains a symbol of East Asian industrial ambition made galactic. It's also a major cultural force, producing branded entertainment, virtual 
    idols, and sponsoring the Interstellar Drift League—a sport made possible by their popular Gaon-7X gravcar.</p>` },
  { name: "Mitsutomo", type: "Zaibatsu", founded: 2094, hq: "Shinhama City, Amaji", motto: "Shape the Future. Serve the Stars.", desc: `
    <p>Mitsutomo began as a small robotics R&D firm in 2094, founded by visionary engineer Aika Mitsutomo and a coalition of post-national investors. Within a few decades, it grew into one of the most powerful
    megacorporations in known space, renowned for its cutting-edge robotics, adaptive AI platforms, and modular terraforming infrastructure.</p>
    <p>By 2140, Mitsutomo had diversified its offerings to include advanced consumer electronics, synthetic food ecosystems, orbital defense arrays, and luxury cybernetic augmentation. However, it is best known 
    for its "Shinjin" line of humanoid robots—used in everything from domestic service to deep-space colonization and combat scenarios. These androids, lauded for their lifelike behavior and ethical adaptive protocols, 
    are the most sought-after robots in the galaxy.</p>
    <p>With a presence on 42 planets across multiple star systems, Mitsutomo also holds voting seats in five interplanetary trade federations and maintains its own private security arm, the <i>Mitsutomo Sentinel 
    Division</i>. The corporation’s influence is so vast that it has been accused—though never proven—of orchestrating regime changes to maintain favourable trade environments.` },
