    <p>Mitsutomo began as a small robotics R&D firm in 2094, founded by visionary engineer Aika Mitsutomo and a coalition of post-national investors. Within a few decades, it grew into one of the most powerful
    megacorporations in known space, renowned for its cutting-edge robotics, adaptive AI platforms, and modular terraforming infrastructure.</p>
    <p>By 2140, Mitsutomo had diversified its offerings to include advanced consumer electronics, synthetic food ecosystems, orbital defense arrays, and luxury cybernetic augmentation. However, it is best known 
    for its "Shinjin" line of humanoid robots—used in everything from domestic service to deep-space colonization and combat scenarios. These androids, lauded for their lifelike behavior and ethical adaptive protocols, 
    are the most sought-after robots in the galaxy.</p>
    <p>With a presence on 42 planets across multiple star systems, Mitsutomo also holds voting seats in five interplanetary trade federations and maintains its own private security arm, the <i>Mitsutomo Sentinel 
    Division</i>. The corporation’s influence is so vast that it has been accused—though never proven—of orchestrating regime changes to maintain favourable trade environments.` },
