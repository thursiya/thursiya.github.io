Plan for multiple screen resolutions:

Mobile (412x892)
Chromebook (1366x768)
Laptop (1440x810)
Desktop (1920x1080)

Typical Device Breakpoints for Media Queries:
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {...} // Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down)
@media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {...} // Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up)
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...} // Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up)
@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {...} // Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up)
@media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {...} // Extra large devices (large laptops and desktops, 1200px and up)
