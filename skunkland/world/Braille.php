		Braille was founded some time around <script>sy(2013,2)</script>.  The city state of Braille is 
		notable for a constant struggle for power amongst its chief families, leaving many urban 
		projects partially completed as the winds of power change.  It joined Delve and Faclair to form 
		the Tseles Protectorate	in <script>sy(2014,4,20,12)</script> which has contributed to an 
		increase of support from its larger neighbours and also to a slow blurring of borders.
