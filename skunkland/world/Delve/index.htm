						<p>
							The modern state of Delve was founded in <script>sy(2011,11)</script> but traces its history back to <span title="September 2011">12 BS</span>. Delve 
							is made up of three provinces, once small struggling nations unified by Delve Co. for mutual benefit. Society is highly regionally stratified with the 
							bulk of Delve's planners coming from Alaris, researchers from Ennist, and its work force from Delve Capital Region. Delve is a member of the Tseles 
							Protectorate (founded in <script>sy(2014,4,20,12)</script>), along with Braille and Faclair.
						</p>
						<p>
							Prior to <script>sy(2014,3,8)</script>, the three provinces of Delve were their own separate territories, each with a ruling family in a monarchy model. 
							In <script>sy(2014,3,8)</script>, Delve Co. as an independent entity was amalgamated with the government of Delve, such as it was at the time. This 
							resulted in the abolition of the ancient monarchies and an adoption of the socialist government model of today. There are many reminders of the old ways 
							throughout the cities and structures of Delve.
