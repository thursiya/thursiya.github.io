		The province of Delve Capital was created as part of Delve's entry into the Tseles Protectorate 
		in <script>sy(2014,4,20,12)</script>.  It is the oldest region in Delve and one of the 
		oldest regions in all of Skunkland with settlement dating from <script>sy(2011,11)</script>. 
		The grand dragon entrance of the region's namesake, Delve City, located in the east of the Delve
		Capital Province, is also the gateway to the nation of Delve and the Tseles Protectorate as a 
		whole.  The province is home to practical, strong-bodied Delvians who form the backbone of 
		Delve's workforce.
