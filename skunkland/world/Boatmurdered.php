		<i>"The townsfolk of Lut Gholein were a simple, happy folk and often wouldn't even notice or 
		perhaps pretended to ignore the sounds of madness that wafted in on the early morning winds. 
		Every day started with the shadow of the ominous spire, the sun slowly peeling away its moist 
		cloying darkness. Inquiries from strangers about the darkened eastern road would often go 
		unanswered.  Legends and myths of the creatures that dwell down that road keep the children 
		safe in their beds.  And young men boasting of bravery march down the road as far as they dare. 
		Some never return."</i>
