		Before joining the Republic of Gavel, Ehecatl enjoyed centuries as a prosperous city state  
		dominating the Boreal Ocean.  But with the rise of Gavel's new showpiece city, Metropolis, to 
		the west and the increasing reliance of the nearby coastal communities on the republic's 
		resources, Ehecatl was eclipsed and its economy shrank.  Many states may have been able to 
		weather such an economic downturn, especially since the belligerent Animan Empire had 
		transformed into the rather peaceful Gavel Republic, however Ehecatl's prosperity had allowed
		a society devoted to the pursuit of knowledge to flourish and the academics of its now 
		all-powerful University of Ehecatl were loathe to give up that lifestyle. So a deal was struck 
		with the city state's powerful neighbour where Ehecatl would give up some of its autonomy and 
		expertise for Gavel's financial and military support. Soon academics from across the republic 
		flocked to Ehecatl and its island-spanning university in the hopes of escaping a little of the 
		attention of Gavel's secret police.  The special administrative region of Ehecatl is in the 
		north of Gavel, covering the Isle of Ehecatl, and is bordered by the Boreal Ocean to the north.
