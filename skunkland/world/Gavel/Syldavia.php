		The state of Syldavia was formed when the Kingdom of Syldavia was conquered by the Animan 
		Empire (later Republic of Gavel).  The kingdom was the last addition to the empire, having 
		once held sway over much of the empire's eastern lands and only weakening as its technology 
		stagnated.  It fell after the Animan navy was able to blockade both its coasts, forcing 
		surrender from the impenetrable Ottokar Fortress.  Today the state has not changed significantly 
		from its medieval founding and its economy is based mostly on tourism and agricultural exports. 
		Syldavia State is in the east of Gavel, bordering on Porcinia to the south.
