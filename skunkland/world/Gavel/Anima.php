		The province of Anima was formed as part of the transformation of the Animan Empire into a 
		modern republic.  The region comprising modern Anima covers the original homeland of the 
		coastal people that joined the central tribes to form the Animan Empire as well as many of 
		the central meeting lands.  Home to Gavel's navy, largest city, and its capital, the importance 
		of the province justified Anima inheriting the predecessor empire's name.  The province of Anima 
		is located in the north and center of Gavel, bordering the Boreal Ocean to the north.
