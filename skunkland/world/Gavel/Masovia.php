		The state of Masovia was formed when the Kingdom of Masovia was annexed by the Animan 
		Empire (later Republic of Gavel).  Long past its heyday, at the time of its annexation the 
		land was mostly filled with nomads and small-time warlords, a kingdom only in name.  The 
		empire's new bureaucracy sought symbols of its legitimacy and invested heavily in rebuilding 
		and restoration projects, particularly in King Asik VIII's Baths Palace which had fallen into 
		disrepair over the century since his golden age had ended.  Today the state blends old and new. 
		Due to its central geography it houses the massive Operis National Distribution Center, the main 
		warehouse facility for Operis Corporation.  Masovia lies in the south of Gavel and borders 
		South Shore to the east.
