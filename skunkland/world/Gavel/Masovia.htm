					The state of Masovia was formed when the Kingdom of Masovia was annexed by the Animan Empire (later Republic of Gavel). Long past its heyday, at the time of its 
					annexation the land was mostly filled with nomads and small-time warlords, a kingdom only in name. The empire's new bureaucracy sought symbols of its legitimacy 
					and invested heavily in rebuilding and restoration projects, particularly in King Asik VIII's Baths Palace, which had fallen into disrepair over the century since 
					his golden age had ended. Today, the state blends old and new. Due to its central geography, it houses the massive Operis National Distribution Center, the main 
					warehouse facility for Operis Corporation. Masovia lies in the south of Gavel and borders South Shore to the east.
