					The state of Syldavia was formed when the Kingdom of Syldavia was conquered by the Animan Empire (later Republic of Gavel). The kingdom was the last addition to the 
					empire, having once held sway over much of the empire's eastern lands, and only weakening as its technology stagnated. It fell after the Animan navy was able to 
					blockade both its coasts, forcing surrender from the impenetrable Ottokar Fortress. Today, the state has not changed significantly from its medieval founding, and 
					its economy is based mostly on tourism and agricultural exports. Syldavia State is in the east of Gavel, bordering on Porcinia to the south.
