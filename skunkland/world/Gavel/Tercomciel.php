		Unlike the other provinces in Gavel, the province of Tercomciel was not formed during the 
		initial declaration of the Gavel Republic.  Tercomciel is the youngest region in Gavel, formed 
		as a buffer zone between the competing state and national interests in Gavel.  The province is 
		primarily home to the city of Celestia, a utopian project of the nation's disenchanted who seek 
		to escape the endless vagaries of the market.  Celestia is home to the Thurail Corporation and 
		houses its hub station.  The province of Tercomciel is located in the center of western Gavel and 
		is completely surrounded by other regions of Gavel.
