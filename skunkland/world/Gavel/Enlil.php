		The province of Enlil was formed as part of the transformation of the Animan Empire into a 
		modern republic.  The region comprising modern Enlil was the original homeland of the desert 
		nomads that joined with the central tribes to form the Animan Empire.  The province of Enlil 
		is located in the center and east of Gavel, bordering the Sea of Gavel to the south.
