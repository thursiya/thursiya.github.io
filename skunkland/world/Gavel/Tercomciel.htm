				<p> 
					Unlike the other provinces in Gavel, the province of Tercomciel was not formed during the initial declaration of the Gavel Republic. Tercomciel is the youngest 
					region in Gavel, formed as a buffer zone between the competing state and national interests in Gavel. The province is primarily home to the city of Celestia, a 
					utopian project of the nation's disenchanted, who seek to escape the endless vagaries of the market. Celestia is home to the Thurail Corporation and houses its hub 
					station. The province of Tercomciel is located in the center of western Gavel and is completely surrounded by other regions of Gavel.
