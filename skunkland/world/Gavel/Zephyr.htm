					The province of Zephyr was formed as part of the transformation of the Animan Empire into a modern republic. The region comprising modern Zephyr was the original 
					homeland of the forest dwellers that joined the central tribes to form the Animan Empire. Before the Great Warming, Zephyr was a forbidding land and its people 
					hardened warriors. Today, it houses the Zephyr Federal Mining Penal Colony, the paramount prison facility in Gavel. The central forest area is now home to the 
					province's largest settlement, Zefram. The province of Zephyr is located in the west of Gavel, bordering Crevatia.
