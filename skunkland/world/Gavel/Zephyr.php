		The province of Zephyr was formed as part of the transformation of the Animan Empire into a 
		modern republic.  The region comprising modern Zephyr was the original homeland of the 
		forest dwellers that joined the central tribes to form the Animan Empire.  Before the Great 
		Warming Zephyr was a forbidding land and its people hardened warriors.  Today it houses the 
		Zephyr Federal Mining Penal Colony, the paramount prison facility in Gavel.  The central 
		forest area is now home to the province's largest settlement, Zefram.  The province of 
		Zephyr is located in the west of Gavel, bordering Crevatia.
