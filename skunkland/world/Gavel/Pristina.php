		The state of Pristina was formed when the Kingdom of Pristina was absorbed into the Animan 
		Empire (later Republic of Gavel).  The kingdom predated the upstart empire by hundreds of 
		years and remains one of the oldest regions in Skunkland (settled in 
		<script>sy(2011,11)</script>).  As part of the merger much of the Pristina bureaucracy 
		helped form the empire's new governing bodies and the Pristina elite were guaranteed powerful 
		positions in the empire's strategic council which would later morph into Gavel's highest 
		executive authority, the Presidium (Gavel Board of Directors).  Pristina State is in the 
		southwest of Gavel and lies on the borders of Crevatia to the west and Koku to the south.

		Much of the southern portion of the state is home to the sprawling city of New Kingsburg, the 
		"Gateway to Gavel".  Pristina politics are dominated by Operis Corporation, which was founded 
		in New Kingsburg and is now (arguably) the most powerful megacorporation in Gavel.  As the 
		"First City of Skunkland" New Kingsburg remains a powerful player in Gavel.  The northern 
		portion of the state is mostly open to tourist and leisure expansion.
