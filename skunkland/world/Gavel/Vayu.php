		The province of Vayu was formed as part of the transformation of the Animan Empire into a 
		modern republic.  Home to small kingdoms over the centuries, the region has never been highly 
		occupied and remains the most frontier-like in Gavel. The province of Vayu is located in the 
		northeast of Gavel, bordering the Boreal Ocean to the north and Levantian Ocean to the east.
