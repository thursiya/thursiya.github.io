					The province of Anima was formed as part of the transformation of the Animan Empire into a modern republic. The region comprising modern Anima covers the original 
					homeland of the coastal people that joined the central tribes to form the Animan Empire, as well as many of the central meeting lands. Home to Gavel's navy, largest 
					planned city, and its capital, the importance of the province justified Anima inheriting the predecessor empire's name. The province of Anima is located in the north 
					and center of Gavel, bordering the Boreal Ocean to the north.
