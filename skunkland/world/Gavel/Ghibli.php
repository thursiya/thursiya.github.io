		The province of Ghibli was formed as part of the transformation of the Animan Empire into a 
		modern republic.  The region comprising modern Ghibli was originally a hinterland between the 
		kingdoms of Pristina and Masovia, home to Romani in the north and to this day the province 
		remains one of the most culturally diverse in Gavel.  Politics in Ghibli are dominated by the 
		Tsai Group who control most of the province's major industries.  The province of Ghibli is in 
		the south of Gavel and borders Koku to the south and South Shore to the east.
