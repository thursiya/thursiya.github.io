					The province of Ghibli was formed as part of the transformation of the Animan Empire into a modern republic. The region comprising modern Ghibli was originally a 
					hinterland between the kingdoms of Pristina and Masovia, home to Romani in the north, and to this day, the province remains one of the most culturally diverse in 
					Gavel. Politics in Ghibli are dominated by the Tsai Group, who control most of the province's major industries. The province of Ghibli is in the south of Gavel 
					and borders Koku to the south and South Shore to the east.
