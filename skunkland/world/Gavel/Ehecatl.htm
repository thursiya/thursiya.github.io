					Before joining the Republic of Gavel, Ehecatl enjoyed centuries as a prosperous city-state dominating the Boreal Ocean. But with the rise of Gavel's new showpiece 
					city, Metropolis, to the west, and the increasing reliance of the nearby coastal communities on the republic's resources, Ehecatl was eclipsed and its economy shrank. 
					Many states may have been able to weather such an economic downturn, especially since the belligerent Animan Empire had transformed into the rather peaceful Gavel 
					Republic, however Ehecatl's prosperity had allowed a society devoted to the pursuit of knowledge to flourish, and the academics of its now all-powerful University of 
					Ehecatl were loathe to give up that lifestyle. So a deal was struck with the city-state's powerful neighbour where Ehecatl would give up some of its autonomy and 
					expertise for Gavel's financial and military support. Soon academics from across the republic flocked to Ehecatl and its island-spanning university in the hopes of 
					escaping a little of the attention of Gavel's secret police. The special administrative region of Ehecatl is in the north of Gavel, covering the Isle of Ehecatl, and 
					is bordered by the Boreal Ocean to the north.
