					The state of Pristina was formed when the Kingdom of Pristina was absorbed into the Animan Empire (later Republic of Gavel). The kingdom predated the upstart empire 
					by hundreds of years and remains one of the oldest regions in Skunkland (settled in <script>sy(2011,11)</script>). As part of the merger, much of the Pristina 
					bureaucracy helped form the empire's new governing bodies, and the Pristina elite were guaranteed powerful positions in the empire's strategic council. This council 
					would later morph into Gavel's highest executive authority, the Presidium (Gavel Board of Directors). Pristina State is in the southwest of Gavel and lies on the 
					borders of Crevatia to the west and Koku to the south.

					Much of the southern portion of the state is home to the sprawling city of New Kingsburg, the "Gateway to Gavel". Pristina politics are dominated by Operis 
					Corporation, which was founded in New Kingsburg and is now (arguably) the most powerful megacorporation in Gavel. As the "First City of Skunkland", New Kingsburg 
					remains a powerful player in Gavel. The northern portion of the state is mostly open to tourist and leisure expansion.
