						<p>
							Crevatia was founded some time around <script>sy(2012,4)</script> as the Dominion of Crevatia. In <script>sy(2016,4)</script> the dominion 
							annexed the villages in the northwest and formed the new Northwest Territory. In <script>sy(2016,5,7)</script> the dominion was overthrown by 
							the military and the Democratic People's Republic of Crevatia was established, transforming from a feudal imperial state to its current form:
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							"The Crevatians have spoken! On behalf of the disenfranchised citizens of Crevatia, the military has overthrown the Dominion and imposed martial 
							law. The new republic of Crevatia is in a state of violent flux, and the governors themselves (Frankerstein, Nomers6, and Gickitty) threatened 
							to secede. But with deft political maneuvering, bribes, and the threat of economic isolation, one governor after another was swayed to remain in 
							the federation. Old flags are being torn down, new banners and soldiers are everywhere, and the old vestiges of the dominion are being swept 
							away as we speak. The old imperial temple is now being refurbished as a hall of heroes for the inspiration of the populace.
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							Travel into the new republic may be disrupted as terrorist bombings have been a way of life in several neighborhoods. But the Crevatians will 
							not cower in fear! Already, they have constructed several new symbols of hope for the future. The Lyceum beacon now rotates through several 
							colours, the mall clock now plays 'Ode to Joy' at noon, and Home Tree is growing - Big. Wearing Elytra and jumping off from the highest points, 
							it is possible to reach Anderson's Crossing, Delve, and almost Lunar Hill.
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							The future of Crevatia is now directly in the hands of the people and regional governors, and with the help of the Military, this glorious future 
							will be guaranteed. Long life to the Republic!"
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							Crevatia is home to five players: yrsyrs, gickitty, frankerstein, Nomers6, and UltimateKillerKG.
