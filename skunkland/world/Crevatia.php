		Crevatia was founded some time around <script>sy(2012,4)</script> as the Dominion of Crevatia. In 
		<script>sy(2016,4)</script> the dominion annexed the villages in the northwest and formed the new 
		Northwest Territory. In <script>sy(2016,5,7)</script> the dominion was overthrown by the military 
		and the Democratic People's Republic of Crevatia was established, transforming from a feudal 
		imperial state to its current form:
		<blockquote>
			<i>"The Crevatians have spoken! On behalf of the disenfranchised citizens of Crevatia, the 
			military has overthrown the Dominion and imposed martial law.  The new republic of 
			Crevatia is in a state of violent flux, and the governors themselves (Frankerstein, 
			Nomers6 and Gickitty) threatened to secede. But with deft political maneuvering, bribes 
			and the threat of economic isolation, one governor after another was swayed to remain in 
			the federation. Old flags are being torn down, new banners and soldiers are everywhere, 
			and the old vestiges of the dominion are being swept away as we speak. The old imperial 
			temple is now being refurbished as a hall of heroes for the inspiration of the populace.
			<br><br>
			Travel into the new republic may be disrupted as terrorist bombings have been a way of 
			life in several neighborhoods. But the Crevatians will not cower in fear! Already, they 
			have constructed several new symbols of hope for the future. The Lyceum beacon now rotates 
			through several colors, the mall clock now plays 'ode to joy' at noon, and home tree is 
			growing. Big. Wearing Elytra and jumping off from the highest points, it is possible to 
			reach Anderson's Crossing, Delve, and almost Lunar Hill.
			<br><br>
			The future of Crevatia is now directly in the hands of the people and regional governors, 
			and with the help of the Military, this glorious future will be guaranteed. Long life to 
			the Republic!"</i>
