					In the world of Skunkland, the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Information in the Republic of Gavel orders a global census from 
					the Department of Information's World Records Office every 100 years. This is the census data that is published in books in game. In the real 
					world, the census is updated on a regular basis as additions are made to the settlements of Skunkland, based on the calculations 
					<a href="calculations.htm">posted here</a>.
