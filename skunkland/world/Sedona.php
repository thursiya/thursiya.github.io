		The Independent State of Sedona was officially founded in <script>sy(2019,12,20)</script>.  
		Previously the territory of Sedona was a frontier colony of Braille, but with the feuding 
		leadership of Braille reaching an impasse Sedona chose to forge an independent identity. 
		The state has scattered homesteads and a proper settlement under construction at Tortilla 
		Flat. Oddly, its most significant structure is actually in a foreign country: the Sedona 
		Embassy in Nexus, Gavel.
