					The province of Delve Capital was created as part of Delve's entry into the Tseles Protectorate in <script>sy(2014,4,20,12)</script>. It is the oldest region in Delve, 
					and one of the oldest regions in all of Skunkland, with settlement dating from <script>sy(2011,11)</script>. The grand dragon entrance of the region's namesake, Delve 
					City, located in the east of the Delve Capital Province, is also the gateway to the nation of Delve and the Tseles Protectorate as a whole. The province is home to 
					practical, strong-bodied Delvians who form the backbone of Delve's workforce.
