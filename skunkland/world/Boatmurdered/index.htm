							"The townsfolk of Lut Gholein were a simple, happy folk and often wouldn't even notice or perhaps pretended to ignore the sounds of madness 
							that wafted in on the early morning winds. Every day started with the shadow of the ominous spire, the sun slowly peeling away its moist 
							cloying darkness. Inquiries from strangers about the darkened eastern road would often go unanswered. Legends and myths of the creatures 
							that dwell down that road keep the children safe in their beds. And young men boasting of bravery march down the road as far as they dare. 
							Some never return."
