	<p>
		The modern state of Delve was founded in <script>sy(2011,11)</script> but traces its 
		history back to <span title="September 2011">12 BS</span>.  Delve is made up of three 
		provinces, once small struggling nations unified by Delve Co. for mutual benefit.  Society is 
		highly regionally stratified with the bulk of Delve's planners coming from Alaris, researchers 
		from Ennist, and its work force from Delve Capital Region.  Delve is a member of the Tseles 
		Protectorate (founded in <script>sy(2014,4,20,12)</script>), along with Braille and 
		Faclair.
	</p>
	<p>
		Prior to <script>sy(2014,3,8)</script> the three provinces of Delve were their own 
		separate territories, each with a ruling family in a monarchy model.  In 
		<script>sy(2014,3,8)</script> Delve Co. as an independent entity was amalgamated with 
		the government of Delve, such as it was at the time.  This resulted in the abolition of the 
		ancient monarchies and an adoption of the socialist government model of today.  There are many 
		reminders of the old ways throughout the cities and structures of Delve.
