							Braille was founded some time around <script>sy(2013,2)</script>. The city-state of Braille is notable for a constant struggle for power amongst 
							its chief families, leaving many urban projects partially completed as the winds of power change. It joined Delve and Faclair to form the Tseles 
							Protectorate in <script>sy(2014,4,20,12)</script>, which has contributed to an increase of support from its larger neighbours and also to a slow 
							blurring of borders.

							Braille is was originally home to three players: SpaceNerds, wezzie18, and 123weedie.
