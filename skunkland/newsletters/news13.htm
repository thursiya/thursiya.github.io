					Christmas is just around the corner and the (real world) weather is looking gloomy so you know that players are trickling back to 
					their home in Skunkland. We are now in version 1.8.1, a slight performance update that should make our 1.8 experience a little smoother.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lots of adventure has been afoot this fall. 1.8 introduced ocean monuments to the world and some players were quick to assemble an 
					expedition to take one on. Jaanke took out the elder guardians at the closest monument to Boatmurdered in the south Levantian ocean 
					right away. Spaceskunks and Shylilie teamed up to take on the monument off the west coast of the large island in Alaris province (Delve); 
					it is currently being gutted and cleared to make a proper guardian farm. Those adventuresome two also fit in a long-planned expedition to 
					the End where they successfully slew the Ender Dragon, whose egg now sits in the Delve museum. Remember to pack potions of nightvision 
					and water-breathing (at a minimum) if you plan to take on a monument yourself. This season most of the building has been happening in the 
					west with sporadic blips in other corners of the world. In Auverland, thursiya completed the towering Executive Hotel Auverland and 
					penthouse, Spaceskunks finished his own ambassadorial home, and Shylilie has completed the market, new homes, and an apartment building. 
					Spaceskunks also completed a logging camp south of Ulve, ready to make shipments to the harbour and trade vessel completed by Quackey958 
					in Badrum Capital. Shylilie has finished work on small settlements and fields east of Auverland. Meanwhile, due to its explosion of 
					construction, a subway route has been cut from Jungle Tours south to Auverland with easy access to Auverland's two largest structures.

					Here are some of our autumn builds. Top row from left: Savvaerk Great Hall and logging camp (Alaris province, Delve); Badrum Capital

				<p><b><i>World Trim</i></b></p>
				<p>
					A massive world trim went ahead on September 11th. Initially a more conservative trim was planned, but it turned out that the basic 
					terrain generation code had not been changed in 1.8 so trimmed chunks regenerated the same, only with the new ores this time. So the trim 
					was very close. In some inexplicable cases we've noticed untrimmed chunks generating the new ores and possibly even regenerating destroyed 
					mob spawners (but otherwise not affecting the changed terrain of the chunk).

				<p><b><i>Featured Build: Cadwgan</i></b></p>
				<p>
					At the beginning of April 2014, Shylilie joined Skunkland and founded a small village southwest of Delve City called Cadwgan. Like many new 
					players' settlements the village started as a simple homestead with access to a mine and then some crops and animals. Unlike many new 
					players, Shylilie quickly expanded the homestead into a full-fledged town, started a new mining community (Endermere), and added so much to 
					both that the border between the two blurred in the spirit of urban conglomeration - all in the space of a couple months. Cadwgan serves as 
					the current capital of the Freenation of Faclair and is home to many cute shops and colourful businesses. Make sure to check out the Rose 
					Garden Pub; Shylilie's special Halloween build, Auld Scald Mansion; and the nearby horse track and sites of Endermere. Cadwgan can be 
					reached by subway south from Braille station, by road west of the University of Ennist (Delve) or south of Braille, or by nether portal 
					(beyond the Delve portal entrance).
