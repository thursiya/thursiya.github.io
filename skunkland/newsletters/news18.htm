				<blockquote>
					Announcement: Just over a decade remains in the third century of Skunkland. To celebrate the arrival of the year 300 the Government 
					of Gavel and the Doggy Magical Corporation are sponsoring the second Century Build Competition. The theme will be Building Together. 
					More to come!

				<p>
					We are still running version 1.8.8, but hopefully 1.9 will be out on time for our next newsletter. It seems things have slowed down 
					a little in the Minecraft universe, but our builders keep knocking out the hits with boundless creativity. If you haven't been on in 
					a while, why not pop on and check out the latest updates before participating in the Century Build Competition (between Christmas 
					and New Year's).
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite spending most of the last few months overseas, Spaceskunks was able to drop by long enough to complete a grand jungle home 
					in Shylilie's new jungle community, Cirrus, which continues to get new tree-houses and updates. Meanwhile, back in New Kingsburg, 
					thursiya and Shylilie tore down Spacenerds' old abandoned house sitting on prime real estate in Northside and replaced it with a 
					modernist commercial/residential plaza featuring a variety of new businesses and swanky new apartments. Downtown, thursiya 
					completely remade the subway station into something more fitting for the first subway station in Skunkland. And in Southside New 
					Kingsburg, there are new businesses in the under mall including an adults-only gentlemen's club. Shylilie has been busy expanding on 
					the massive Lone Tree Mine and on the various mysterious structures dotting the hillside. Expect to see more subway expansion in the 
					works as a site for the next Century Build Competition is chosen.

					Some things we've been working on and special bits from the past. Clockwise from top left: Cutter's Junction (South Shore); Temple 
					of M0gar (Imperial City, Badrum); Northside Plaza (New Kingsburg); Crevasse Subway Station; Shylilie's House in Northside (New 
					Kingsburg); Fapworthy's club (New Kingsburg); Campsite (east of Crevasse); New Kingsburg Downtown Subway Station; Spaceskunks' tree 
					mansion (Cirrus, Faclair); Red Rock (south of Spawn); Eye Building and hall beneath it (outside Auverland).

				<p class="heading">Resource Packs</p>
				<p>
					Not everyone is happy with Minecraft in its most basic default visual scheme and many opt for installing a resource pack. There are 
					tons of resource packs to choose from, and you can install multiple packs then switch between them on the fly. HD resource packs 
					exist with textures at a higher resolution than default. There are a large number of modern style resource packs to counter the fact 
					that default tends toward a slightly primitive or medieval look. Although our site features pictures taken in default, many of our 
					players opt for resource packs. For example, Shylilie and Spaceskunks like "<a href="https://www.johnsmithlegacy.co.uk/">John Smith 
					Legacy</a>". And if your tastes are more Zelda-esque, then check out <a href="https://jehkoba.com/jehkobas-fantasy">Jehkoba's Fantasy 
					Resource Pack</a>, made by our very own Jehkoba!

				<p class="heading">Featured Build: Dragon Ridge</p>
				<p>
					Back in April 2014 Jehkoba joined the server with a mission: to build a beautiful settlement tucked into the side of a mountain face. 
					That settlement started with a standard player's house (still standing) with bed and storage and stairs to a strip mine. Soon the 
					face of the mountainside was being carved away and posh cave homes started appearing. Before long, stables, a watchtower, and ornately 
					shaped roads and stairs joined villas to make a large town in the south that's still growing. The little road leading from town and 
					disappearing south is a reminder that Dragon Ridge is intended as the first of many communities that will form in the Hanse of Amahn, 
					marching into the mesa and savanna of the south. Make sure you check out the customs area, surrounding roads and bridges, and the 
					dragon bones being unearthed to the west of the town. Dragon Ridge can be reached by road south of Sofia (look for the watchtower's 
					flag because the town is hiding behind the hill), by subway south from Sofia or east from Red Rock, or by nether portal.
