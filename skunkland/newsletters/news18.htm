	<p class="big"><b><i>*** The New Kingsburg Monitor ***</i></b></p>
	<p><i>
		Announcement: Just over a decade remains in the third century of Skunkland.  To celebrate the 
		arrival of the year 300 the Government of Gavel and the Doggy Magical Corporation are sponsoring 
		the second Century Build Competition.  The theme will be Building Together.  More to come!
	</i></p>
	<p>
		We are still running version 1.8.8 but hopefully 1.9 will be out on time for our next 
		newsletter.  It seems things have slowed down a little in the Minecraft universe, but our 
		builders keep knocking out the hits with boundless creativity.  If you haven't been on in a 
		while, why not pop on and check out the latest updates before participating in the Century 
		Build Competition (between Christmas and New Year's).

		Despite spending most of the last few months overseas, Spaceskunks was able to drop by long 
		enough to complete a grand jungle home in Shylilie's new jungle community, Cirrus, which 
		continues to get new tree-houses and updates.  Meanwhile, back in New Kingsburg, thursiya and 
		Shylilie tore down Spacenerds' old abandoned house sitting on prime real estate in Northside 
		and replaced it with a modernist commercial/residential plaza featuring a variety of new 
		businesses and swanky new apartments.  Downtown thursiya completely remade the subway station 
		into something more fitting for the first subway station in Skunkland.  And in Southside New 
		Kingsburg there are new businesses in the under mall including an adults-only gentlemen's club.  
		Shylilie has been busy expanding on the massive Lone Tree Mine and on the various mysterious 
		structures dotting the hillside.  Expect to see more subway expansion in the works as a site 
		for the next Century Build Competition is chosen.

	<p><b><i>Resource Packs</i></b></p>
	<p>
		Not everyone is happy with Minecraft in its most basic default visual scheme and many opt for 
		installing a resource pack.  There are tons of resource packs to choose from and you can install 
		multiple packs then switch between them on the fly.  HD resource packs exist with textures at 
		a higher resolution than default.  There are a large number of modern style resource packs to 
		counter the fact that default tends toward a slightly primitive or medieval look.  Although our 
		site features pictures taken in default, many of our players opt for resource packs.  For 
		example, Shylilie and Spaceskunks like "<a href="https://www.johnsmithlegacy.co.uk/">John Smith 
		Legacy</a>".  And if your tastes are more Zelda-esque, then check out 
		<a href="http://www.jehkoba.com/jehkobas-fantasy.php">Jehkoba's Fantasy Resource Pack</a>, made 
		by our very own Jehkoba!

	<p><b><i>Featured Build: Dragon Ridge</i></b></p>
	<p>
		Back in April 2014 Jehkoba joined the server with a mission: to build a beautiful settlement 
		tucked into the side of a mountain face.  That settlement started with a standard player's 
		house (still standing) with bed and storage and stairs to a strip mine.  Soon the face of the 
		mountainside was being carved away and posh cave homes started appearing.  Before long stables, 
		a watchtower, ornately shaped roads and stairs joined villas to make a large town in the south 
		that's still growing.  The little road leading from town and disappearing south is a reminder 
		that Dragon Ridge is intended as the first of many communities that will form in the Hanse of 
		Amahn, marching into the mesa and savanna of the south.  Make sure you check out the customs 
		area, surrounding roads and bridges, and the dragon bones being unearthed to the west of the 
		town.  Dragon Ridge can be reached by road south of Sofia (look for the watchtower's flag 
		because the town is hiding behind the hill), by subway south from Sofia or east from Red Rock, 
		or by nether portal.
