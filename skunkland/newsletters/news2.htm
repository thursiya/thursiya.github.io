				<p><b>September 2012</b></p>
				<p class="big"><b><i>*** The New Kingsburg Monitor ***</i></b></p>
				<p>
					We are currently on version 1.3.2, a slight fix to version 1.3.1. Which also means there are some bugs to watch out for:<br>
					- text on signs randomly doesn't load (relog to display)<br>
					- 3m falls now cause 0.5 hearts of damage, which means that jumping while you are walking down a gentle slope could damage you<br>
					- nether portals are misaligned and have partially reverted to redirecting traffic to the oldest portals
				</p>
				<p>
					The first meeting of the four nations was held during August to discuss server issues. Here is a brief version of what was settled:<br>
					- the server name issue remains quite difficult to resolve and is still being debated<br>
					- the world map will be trimmed south of spawn and west of Delve to allow for 1.3 world generation for new players (trim completed last week)<br>
					- a set of basic constitutional principles were agreed upon including: no PvP/griefing/stealing, reasonable limits on the use of creative powers 
					(such as server business or landscape error fixes, but definitely not builds)<br>
					- the UN/League of Nations organization (name yet to be decided) will be located on top of Mount Pacifica with design proposals being considered 
					now (email one if you're interested)<br>
				</p>
				<p>
					In the last month considerable extensions to the residential area of The Crevasse were made, as well as a number of farms and windmills popping 
					up around Crevatia. The subway network has now extended to Stellarton (North from William's Harbour Station) and will soon extend to Masovia 
					State and West Koku. Delve is now mostly cleared out and is currently filled with tree farms. Tetriston has a new mayor and has been renamed 
					"Jonville". The Gavel road system now stretches uninterrupted from the western border in Pristina State all the way to the eastern border in 
					Masovia state.

				<p><b><i>Featured Build: New Kingsburg</i></b></p>
				<p>
					This month's featured build is New Kingsburg by thursiya. New Kingsburg is the first city in Skunkland, under continuous construction from 
					January 2012 to the present (same as Delve). At the geographic center of the explored world, New Kingsburg is the global economic capital and 
					the temporary hub of the Thurail Subway line. The city was founded in a bend of the Spawn River just beyond the tundra and is now the capital 
					of Pristina State, the southwesternmost region of the Republic of Gavel. The first build in New Kingsburg (and one of the oldest completed 
					builds on the server) was the Operis Corporate Tower, home to Gavel's largest construction firm. The city has expanded beyond its original 
					downtown core, across the river to the Northside suburb, and across the ravine to the Marina District. There are still a large number of 
					structures planned for New Kingsburg, the latest completed build being the New Kingsburg Courthouse. Make sure to check out the Mandor 
					Memorial Medical Center, Astromedica Research Labs, Northside Flats, the Pristina State Capitol, and go up to the observation deck of the 
					world's tallest building, the Operis Corporate Tower. New Kingsburg can be reached via subway (east from Desert Town and Crevasse), by 
					heading east up the Spawn River, by road east of Crevasse or west of Ghibli Port, or by nether portal.
