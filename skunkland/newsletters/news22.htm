				<blockquote>
					The Glorious Field, Faclair - Farmers at the Glorious Field (located near the Faclair airport) claim to have sighted an unidentified 
					flying object that they blame for a recent rash of crop circles. Local skeptics believe air traffic from the nearby airport to be the 
					cause, however one noted T.V. historian and hairspray enthusiast is quick to believe the farmers stating, "I'm not saying it's aliens..."

					Life on the server is busier than ever; a recent day saw 7 people on at the same time! We are currently running version 1.9.2, 
					essentially some minor bug fixes from the major 1.9 update. Although the occasional player can be spotted sporting a banner-emblazoned 
					shield, most of the great 1.9 updates have yet to be seen as our players have not yet ventured into the new End dimension. Yrsyrs is 
					attempting to gather an adventuring party to brave that fell portal and its revived guardian, hopefully some time in the next couple of weeks.

					SpaceSkunks has been busy working on a variety of redstone devices including the NetherFied Chicken restaurant franchise and the new 
					villager eugenics program on the north side of Delve, which will offer designer-villagers to interested parties. The new Faclair Airport, 
					located south of Endermere and east of Auverland, has taken up most of Shylilie's time this month, and a freshly-cut nether flight 
					connection to Persson International is already the busiest international flight route, spanning most of the settled world in roughly one 
					minute.	Shylilie and thursiya have also teamed up with SpaceSkunks to start construction on the Red Rose Mall (part of the prize package 
					for the Century Build). Nomers6 has put some major upgrades into Anderson's Crossing, notably Anderson Gardens, a combination outdoor 
					recreational site. Thursiya's big updates have been the Auverland subway station business upgrade project and building a complex 
					auto-sorting/smelting facility in New Kingsburg. Having finally given up on interesting new players in building at the three naturally 
					generated towns northwest of Crevatia, yrsyrs has officially annexed the region and upgraded them, Crevatia-style, to the towns of 
					Campania, Narbo, and Pontia (connected by roads and a new overland subway route west from Noricum). The subway system has added the 
					Botanical Garden station at the flower forest west of Braille in northern Faclair, connecting to Badrum, Braille, and Jungle Tours.

					There's lots to see in this month's build update. Clockwise from top left: NetherFied Chicken (Delve City); Western approach to Eweton 
					(Crevatia); Fireworks at Anderson Gardens (Anderson's Crossing, Provinces, Crevatia); Minecraft party; Main drag in Pontia (Northwest 
					Territory, Crevatia); New Kingsburg Smelter (Gavel); Faclair Airport (south of Endermere); Auverland Subway Concourse (Faclair); 
					Villager Eugenics (Delve City); Botanical Garden station (northern Faclair); Glorious Field (east of Auverland).

				<p class="heading">New Server Address and Server Updates</p>
				<p>
					The server has been moved to our new host, Minecraftserver.net, since our last newsletter. Make sure that your server address is 
					updated to the new address: 192.169.44.134:25584. Also, we have now enabled command blocks and installed a basic sleep checker. Normally 
					all online players in the overworld must be sleeping at the same time to skip the night (forcing people to run for beds or log off), but 
					this new sleep checker will allow us to skip the night if only one player is sleeping. Please forward any comments/concerns/bug reports 
					regarding this new feature.
				</p>
				
				<p class="heading">Featured Build: Anderson's Crossing</p>
				<p>
					Like most of the settlements in Crevatia, Anderson's Crossing started as a naturally generated village that yrsyrs added to and upgraded. 
					It was soon handed over to the care of Nomers6, who setup permanent shop at the location. Originally a small farming town on the route 
					to Crevatia's northern frontier, marking the detour to The Trident, Anderson's Crossing is now the third largest town in Crevatia, 
					boasting a sizeable collection of businesses and some new homes to add to the original farm homesteads. Recently the town has gained a 
					variety of retail outlets including some Crevatian franchises, such as Gizmo's Gadgets and Baetica Banners, and a new garden-themed park 
					in the east. Make sure you check out Anderson Gardens, the Nomers6 Official Residence (home of the first redstone-wired internal lighting 
					system), and take a day trip east to the Dragon's Tail Inn and Trident park. Anderson's Crossing can be reached by road or subway north 
					from Eweton or east from Noricum.
