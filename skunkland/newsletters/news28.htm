				<blockquote>
					Announcement: Hankering for your weekly hit of General Tso's? Mr. Tsai's! Looking for a restaurant open while gentiles celebrate 
					Christmas? Mr. Tsai's! Craving fine ethnic Chinese cuisine? The other guys! Mr. Tsai's has been serving up for decades the chop suey, 
					sweet & sour pork, and fortune cookies people of Skunkland can't get enough of, never skimping on the MSG. New locations opening up 
					soon, or join us in Crevasse or the Red Rose Mall.

					This is just a "mini" newsletter to get our players ready for this month's big event - the Year 400 Century Build Competition. 
					Unfortunately Mojang seems to have decided to draw out the release of 1.12 for much longer than we anticipated, so it's doubtful we'll 
					have access to the new blocks by the time the build is upon us &#x1f62d;.
				</p>
				<p>
					The newsletter includes a special "Mystery Location" attachment, featuring 7 locations around Skunkland. Can you figure out where any 
					of them are taken? The answers will be revealed in the next newsletter. Discussion is active online if you want to see how you fare 
					against your fellow builders, which brings us to...

					Thanks to the social media prowess of our very own Shylilie, we have a Facebook group running: 
					<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/delveco/">SknkLand Server Community</a> (apparently Facebook thinks 'skunk' is a bad word). 
					The group is closed, so send a message this way to join. The SknkLand Server Community has all of the latest discussion and last minute 
					updates (especially in case of server downtime or address changes).

				<p class="heading">Century Build Competition</p>
				<p>
					It's finally here! Did the 4th century turn out the way you expected? Skunk Year 400 begins May 18, 2017 and goes until May 23, 2017 (so 
					coincidentally lining up with Victoria Day long weekend this time around). The century build competition will take place on the Enlil 
					Exposition grounds (take the subway north from Jeda station, in the middle of the province of Enlil, Gavel, near the pyramid) throughout 
					the year 400. If you haven't participated in a Century Build before, then you should know that players will have the opportunity to 
					participate in various themed builds and create something of their own choosing at the designated sites in the competition location, 
					using blocks they bring to the site. Some food and beds will be on site available to players. The theme of this competition is "Home away 
					from Home" - the builds interpret how you view Skunkland as a second home. The first build is the literal home: choose a site along the 
					road winding to the northwest, and construct a replica of a home you've lived in before, in the real world. If you choose to construct an 
					apartment, suite, or other non-detached dwelling, then you may want to imagine it as a detached dwelling with roof, etc. The second build 
					is the figurative home: there will be space around the exposition station for two dimensional block artwork or for three dimensional 
					installation works exploring the idea of home. The third build is the home in community: players are asked to share their memories, 
					wishes, thoughts, and important experiences of Skunkland on signs (some provided) on a memory wall. At the end of the competition, the 
					signs will be moved to form a special Voices of Skunkland exhibition hall in the dedicated museum facility that will be built up around 
					the second build. Spaces for building your own thing will be available around the central exposition site. At the conclusion of the 
					competition, prizes (both blocks/items and intangibles) will be awarded by the Tsai Group to all participants and for the best efforts. 
					We hope to see you in just over a week!
