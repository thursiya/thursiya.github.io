		This is just a "mini" newsletter to get our players ready for this month's big event - the 
		Year 400 Century Build Competition.  Unfortunately Mojang seems to have decided to draw out 
		the release of 1.12 for much longer than we anticipated so it's doubtful we'll have access 
		to the new blocks by the time the build is upon us :(
	</p>
	<p>
		The newsletter includes a special "Mystery Location" attachment, featuring 7 locations 
		around Skunkland.  Can you figure out where any of them are taken?  The answers will be 
		revealed in the next newsletter.  Discussion is active online if you want to see how you 
		fare against your fellow builders, which brings us to...

		Thanks to the social media prowess of our very own Shylilie we have a Facebook group running: 
		<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/delveco/">SknkLand Server Community</a> (apparently 
		Facebook thinks 'skunk' is a bad word).  The group is closed so send a message this way to 
		join.  The SknkLand Server Community has all of the latest discussion and last minute updates 
		(especially in case of server downtime or address changes).

	<p><b><i>Century Build Competition</i></b></p>
	<p>
		It's finally here (did the 4th century turn out the way you expected?).  Skunk Year 400 begins 
		May 18, 2017 and goes until May 23, 2017 (so coincidentally lining up with Victoria Day long 
		weekend this time around).  The century build competition will take place on the Enlil 
		Exposition grounds (take the subway north from Jeda station, in the middle of the province of 
		Enlil, Gavel, near the pyramid) throughout the year 400.  If you haven't participated in a 
		Century Build before then you should know that players will have the opportunity to participate 
		in various themed builds and create something of their own choosing at the designated sites in 
		the competition location, using blocks they bring to the site.  Some food and beds will be on 
		site available to players.  The theme of this competition is "Home away from Home" - the builds 
		interpret how you view Skunkland as a second home.  The first build is the literal home: choose 
		a site along the road winding to the northwest and construct a replica of a home you've lived 
		in before in the real world.  If you choose to construct an apartment, suite, or other 
		non-detached dwelling then you may want to imagine it as a detached dwelling with roof, etc. 
		The second build is the figurative home: there will be space around the exposition station for 
		two dimensional block artwork or for three dimensional installation works exploring the idea of 
		home.  The third build is the home in community: players are asked to share their memories, 
		wishes, thoughts, and important experiences of Skunkland on signs (some provided) on a memory 
		wall.  At the end of the competition the signs will be moved to form a special Voices of 
		Skunkland exhibition hall in the dedicated museum facility that will be built up around the 
		second build.  Spaces for building your own thing will be available around the central exposition 
		site.  At the conclusion of the competition prizes (both blocks/items and intangibles) will be 
		awarded by the Tsai Group to all participants and for the best efforts.  We hope to see you in 
		just over a week!
