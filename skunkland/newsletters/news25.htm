				<p class="big heading">*** The New Kingsburg Monitor ***</p>
				<blockquote>
					Advertisement: Everything must go - bricks, obsidian, redstone, end stone and more. The Block is Skunkland's premier shopping destination 
					for uncommon building supplies, featuring an inventory that's continually updated, so hurry in, because these sales won't last. With 
					locations in Patria, Auverland, and Delve, plus our newest location opening soon in Gavel. Nobody beats The Block.

					Here comes the rain, torrents of rain, and you're stuck inside joining us in Skunkland &#x1f60a;. We are still running version 1.10.2, but 
					the snapshots suggest that 1.11 is just around the corner - can't wait for llamas! Now might be the time to venture into the End and get 
					comfortable with the landscape, so you're ready to collect shulker shells - just don't forget your pumpkin helmet! We welcomed a couple 
					new casual players in the last month and saw some returns from old standbys.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thursiya has finally opened up building sites in Mellon Bay for the prize packages from the Century Build 300 and has added a town hall 
					and medium-sized church, Notre Dame Stella Maris. Shylilie and Spaceskunks have done more work in Patria, notably Ms. Lemon's Pies and 
					partial construction of Hastings Manor. In the mean time, Spaceskunks has started adding the air bag to the airship and a new secret 
					project in distant lands. Shylilie found a home for all of those skeletal horses she keeps collecting and has retired them to the Artax 
					Sanctum, built in Cadwgan next to the haunted house, then she moved on to finishing the giant tree project. Somewhere north of Braille, 
					Weedie and Wezzie are busy on a new town, Sedona - or is it Tortilla Flats? Dropkickz has begun eliminating the long distance rail bridge 
					over the Levantian Ocean to the Far East and replacing it with a rail line that runs under the ocean floor. The subway has been expanded 
					in Gavel, linking Baetica, Zefram, Northside New Kingsburg (and soon Celestia) to a new station in northern Pristina state.

					A few of the latest builds in Skunkland. Top to bottom, left to right: Mesa Importers, Town Hall & Church (Mellon Bay, Masovia state, 
					Gavel); Ms. Lemon's Pies (Patria, Faclair); New community (south of Auverland); Enderman Grinder (The End); Interior of the giant tree 
					(near Cirrus, Faclair); Notre Dame Stella Maris (Mellon Bay); Sedona under construction (west of Desert Town); Artax Sanctum (Cadwgan, 
					Faclair); Airship under construction (Delve City).

				<p class="heading">5-Year Anniversary</p>
				<p>
					The Skunkland server has been running for a long time. We founded the server at the beginning of December 2011, which means we are 
					approaching the 5th (real world) anniversary of this land we call a second home. Although we've been through trims and cleanups, we've 
					maintained the fabulous builds that trace their history right back to the beginning. Players have come, players have gone, and some 
					players have relocated in Skunkland to get a fresh start. There are very few Minecraft servers in the world as old and glorious as 
					Skunkland. So what are you going to do to celebrate 5 years of adventure, exploration, community, and dreams brought to life? Will it be 
					a grand tour, a celebratory build, or a dangerous quest? In the meantime, consider donating some money to Spaceskunks, who pays to keep 
					this server running for our collective enjoyment.

				<p class="heading">Publishing Books</p>
				<p>
					Minecraft isn't just a great place to explore your talents as an architect or dabble in electrical engineering, the world is also full of 
					wonderful ways to express culture and share in the arts. One of those ways is publishing books. By grabbing a "book & quill" (combine a 
					book with an ink sac and a feather) you can type up and edit your magnum opus until you're ready to publish it and (hopefully) share it 
					with others in Skunkland. Right now there's a dearth of reading material in Skunkland, mostly consisting of a few records, small notes, 
					and "Gods & Goddess" (of Badrum). Each book can have up to 50 pages and hold over 12,000 characters, including the majority of Unicode 
					characters that can be pasted in just like conventional text. Formatting codes can also be used to add bold, italics, underlining, or 
					even colour - all available in survival mode! So maybe it's a guide, travelogue, recipe book, romance novel, or even legal papers you 
					will publish as the next must-have book in Skunkland.

				<p class="heading">Featured Build: Tree Tower</p>
				<p>
					The lands east of the communes have seen a number of iterations, but now we've got our first major builds emerging. Initially the 
					peninsula was settled before the founding of the communes but abandoned after a server change. Then easy_spirit settled east of South 
					Shore's borders and began a build of platforms and trees. Eventually Dropkickz arrived, taking over the old build, and in the same vein, 
					constructing next to it a massive towering spiral of trees and steps. This would become Tree Tower (after a few name changes) and 
					Dropkickz would add treehouses and even a chicken farm hidden away inside. Deep down, a large quarry in the centre connects to tunnels 
					that start the rail route to the Far East, a continent away, making Tree Tower the only outpost on the central continent of a distant 
					empire. This route originally went above ground at the eastern shore of the continent onto a very long cobble bridge, but Dropkickz has 
					recently started demolishing the bridge and replacing it with an undersea rail. The tower is still undergoing construction, but another 
					tree tower is in the works in the Far East. Make sure to check out the deep pit in the midst of Tree Tower and see if you can find a way 
					amongst the stairs and foliage to get to the top of the tower! Tree Tower can be reached by nether portal (spotty connection status), by 
					road east of Cutter's Junction or south of Porcinia, or by subway.
