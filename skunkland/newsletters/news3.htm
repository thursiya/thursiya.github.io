				<p><b>October 2012</b></p>
				<p class="big"><b><i>*** The New Kingsburg Monitor ***</i></b></p>
				<p>
					The October newsletter was delayed until the end of the month to coincide with the release of version 1.4 and the major 
					<script>wiki("Pretty Scary Update")</script>. We are currently on version 1.4.2.
				</p>
				<p>
					Important changes and updates to our players include:<br>
					- new decorations, in particular <script>wiki("flower pots")</script> and <script>wiki("item frames")</script> (even a 
					new painting)<br>
					- <script>wiki("cobblestone walls")</script> (and mossy ones too)<br>
					- <script>wiki("buttons")</script> now come in stone/wood varieties and the crafting recipe is now just one block<br>
					- <script>wiki("carrots")</script> and <script>wiki("potatoes")</script>, which can be found in new villages or are rarely dropped by zombies<br>
					- <script>wiki("pumpkin pie")</script>! (because it's Halloween)<br>
					- <script>wiki("maps")</script> can now be 'zoomed' out by adding paper and can be copied<br>
					- <script>wiki("anvils")</script>, which can be used to repair tools and gear and keep their enchantments!<br>
					- <script>wiki("leather armour")</script> and dog collars can now be dyed<br>
					- <script>wiki("witch huts")</script> and dangerous <script>wiki("witches")</script> in new swamps<br>
					- <script>wiki("wither skeletons")</script> in the nether<br>
					- for those who like to ride pigs, now they can be directed with a <script>wiki("carrot on a stick")</script> and you get the saddle back when they die<br>
					- a use for seeds! (chickens are now bred with seeds and pigs with carrots)<br>
					- you will notice some new sounds for various blocks<br>
					- apparently the mob suffocation and teleporting pets bugs have been fixed, but the disappearing sign text issue remains
				</p>

					For a complete list of changes in this and previous updates see <script>wiki("Java Edition version history")</script>.

					During September/October the most notable build would be Steve's South Shore and its large hotel. A large airport has been started 
					in central Gavel with the first airplane taking shape. A new primitive village has sprung up on the west shore of the Midgewater 
					Swamp. The subway network has now extended to Spawn, Anderson's Crossing, the Baths Palace, and South Shore with plans to move 
					north to the airport under construction. See if you can find where the four build examples are located on the server.

				<p><b><i>Featured Build: The Crevasse</i></b></p>
				<p>
					This month's featured build is The Crevasse by yrsyrs. The Crevasse started as a large ravine in a swamp, halfway between Delve and 
					New Kingsburg along the newly built subway. Yrsyrs found the location inspiring and decided to construct a ravine sanctuary. During 
					the early days of the Crevasse one could see giant wall murals of Mario characters. The original ravine sanctuary morphed into the 
					large "Home Tree" which would form the center of a sprawling city. The crevasse was hollowed out further in an aggressive TNT 
					restructuring to take on its current form. Much of the swamp on the north side of the city was filled in to make room for a new 
					residential district. The Crevasse is notable for housing the first shops on the server and some of the first foreign franchises. 
					The city is still being expanded, with new stores and houses popping up regularly. Besides the shops in town and the exceptional 
					subway station, make sure to check out some of the interesting things on the outskirts of town, such as the Mechwarrior (which once 
					burned down the top of the Home Tree by accident), Crevatian Palace, Volcano Portal, and the graveyard. The Crevasse can be reached 
					via subway (east from Desert Town), by heading due north from Spawn, by road east of Desert Town or west of New Kingsburg, or by 
					nether portal (in the volcano on the east side of town).
