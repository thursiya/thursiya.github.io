		During September/October the most notable build would be Steve's South Shore and its large 
		hotel.  A large airport has been started in central Gavel with the first airplane taking shape. 
		A new primitive village has sprung up on the west shore of the Midgewater Swamp.  The subway 
		network has now extended to Spawn, Anderson's Crossing, the Baths Palace, and South Shore with 
		plans to move north to the airport under construction.  See if you can find where the four 
		build examples are located on the server.

	<p><b><i>Featured Build: The Crevasse</i></b></p>
	<p>
		This month's featured build is The Crevasse by yrsyrs.  The Crevasse started as a large ravine 
		in a swamp, halfway between Delve and New Kingsburg along the newly built subway.  Yrsyrs found 
		the location inspiring and decided to construct a ravine sanctuary.  During the early days of 
		the Crevasse one could see giant wall murals of Mario characters.  The original ravine 
		sanctuary morphed into the large "Home Tree" which would form the center of a sprawling city. 
		The crevasse was hollowed out further in an aggressive TNT restructuring to take on its current 
		form.  Much of the swamp on the north side of the city was filled in to make room for a new 
		residential district.  The Crevasse is notable for housing the first shops on the server and 
		some of the first foreign franchises.  The city is still being expanded, with new stores and 
		houses popping up regularly.  Besides the shops in town and the exceptional subway station, 
		make sure to check out some of the interesting things on the outskirts of town, such as the 
		Mechwarrior (which once burned down the top of the Home Tree by accident), Crevatian Palace, 
		Volcano Portal, and the graveyard.  The Crevasse can be reached via subway (east from Desert 
		Town), by heading due north from Spawn, by road east of Desert Town or west of New Kingsburg, 
		or by nether portal (in the volcano on the east side of town).
