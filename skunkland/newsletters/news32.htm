				<p>
					We are currently running version 1.13.2, a minor performance update to the Update Aquatic.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our players have been busy with competitions, improving build sites, and expanding the economy. SpaceSkunks ventured out of Lumina for a spell 
					to complete Delve Co. Department Stores in Auverland and New Kingsburg, selling a large variety of items. Shylilie added a Faclair visitor 
					centre on the eastern border and has been expanding Sartori with an aquarium and now apartments in the works. She also started a new community 
					around an ink farm north of Cadwgan, built an outdoor market into Skaald Fortress in the nether, and rebuilt all of The Block locations to 
					allow for their expanded sale offerings. Thursiya has been mostly busy maintaining the economy and adding custom heads and maps to the world 
					but has taken a break to add a LazRec recycling facility in Auverland, relocate the Pristina Capitol subway station slightly to the south, and 
					begin work on an underground mall connecting the capitol, subway station, and New Kingsburg Delve Co. store.
				</p>
				<p>
					We have so many recently built things that there wasn't room to feature everything. In this build example, from left to right, top to bottom: 
					Dog Patch Day Camp (Cadwgan, Faclair); Horisageru Sushi (Delve Co. Department Store, New Kingsburg); Lumina Fire & Rescue; Tseles Bank of 
					Commerce (Auverland); Architectural experiments (Far East); Delve Co. Department Store (Auverland); Faclair Vistor Centre (Northeast Faclair); 
					Sartori Aquarium; Nether Plaza (Skaald Fortress, Nether); LazRec Industrial Recycling (Auverland).

				<p class="heading">New Contest - Skyscrapers of Skunkland</p>
				<p>
					Shylilie will be moderating a new building contest. Once per real world year, Skunkland players will be able to participate in a 30 day long 
					build contest that is all about making the tallest buildings in Skunkland! The Skyscrapers of Skunkland contest will run every calendar year, 
					starting December 4th and ending in the New Year on January 2nd. Players must bring their own supplies, but a home base with Ender Chest and 
					basic supplies to get each player started will be provided.
				</p>
				<p>
					Skyscrapers of Skunkland year one will take place next to Auverland, at the west end of the Faclair Airport (which is about to undergo 
					construction so that buildings won't impede the flight paths). Building spots have been set aside, with more spots available at an alternate 
					location if more players are wanting to join in. This year's theme is "Organic Matters", and the contest runs from December 4, 2018 to January 
					2, 2019. What does Organic Building mean to you? Incorporate that into your style. Skyscrapers must have a minimum of 7 floors and a maximum 
					altitude of Y: 124 (with only small details allowed above that height). They must be office or business use and incorporate one "highest in 
					Skunkland" themed space on the top floor (e.g. highest restaurant, gym, movie theatre). Terraforming (using any "organic" material you like 
					for aesthetics or functionality) from the provided flat ground is very welcome but not required. All participants will receive an award for 
					their builds, and a special prize will be awarded to the builder who best captures the theme "Organic Matters". The grand prize winner will 
					also get to choose the next build site and location! The contest has just begun so grab a site and start building up, up, up...
				</p>
				
				<p class="heading">Century Build Competition</p>
				<p>
					Our fourth Century Build competition may have had smaller scale participation, but it had the largest scale creations yet. Our contestants 
					worked at the special Expo 500 Undersea site, located beneath the waves of the Boreal Ocean, somewhere between the coasts of Crevatia and 
					Gavel (most easily reached through the nether). Players built giant sea creatures outside of the dome and added a deep sea club, sushi 
					restaurant, and pineapple under the sea to the small community in the dome. The winner of the official competition was SpaceSkunks, who 
					constructed an epic bioluminescent octopus threatening to take over the dome. Participants are awarded prize packages, including a special 
					Century Build edition custom gPhone 500 smartphone. Who knows what's in store for our next Century Build?
