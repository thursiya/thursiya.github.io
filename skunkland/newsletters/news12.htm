		It's been a while since we've had a regular newsletter update.  Most of the work this summer can 
		be attributed to Shylilie and Spaceskunks.  Shylilie has move ahead full steam building her 
		future capital city of Auverland and it already includes many stately buildings and Shylilie is 
		open to other players' requests for building sites.  After completing a small residential 
		expansion on the western outskirts of Delve, Spaceskunks has headed into the Swamp of Joy to 
		build the world's first witch spawner, and then a little further south to start construction of 
		the nordic settlement Ulve.  On another break from constructing the Ottokar Fortress, thursiya 
		has completed the Century Tower condominiums in Southside New Kingsburg to celebrate the year 
		200.  New player Quackey958 has been busy expanding the Badrum Imperium, including the large, 
		walled capital city and the village of Alf-Wy.  Quackey958 has also cut a subway route from the 
		Badrum capital all the way to Braille (over 1km) and there are new connections west from Cadwgan 
		to Jungle Tours and east from Century Build to Southside New Kingsburg.

	<p><b><i>New Server and World Maintenance</i></b></p>
	<p>
		On August 15th our server went down due to an error in the roll-out of MCMA's latest update 
		(MCMA is the server control software we use that our server host leases).  We eventually had to 
		solve the issue by starting a new server but fortunately all of our world files were intact and 
		no work was lost.  If you haven't done so already, please update your server info to the new 
		address: sc26.servercraft.co:21746
	</p>
	<p>
		With the release of 1.8 there are new blocks spawned during world generation so users have 
		discussed the possibility of doing another world trim to have closer access to the new blocks.  
		We are looking for any input regarding this proposal (agree, disagree, possible trimlines).  
		Barring user input admin will go ahead with trimming a small portion of the world map.  Another 
		issue to discuss is the possibility of nerfing mob terrain damage - meaning that endermen and 
		creepers would no longer alter the environment.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p><b><i>Century Build Competition</i></b></p>
	<p>
		Thanks to all of the participants who came out during the year 200 to build a statue for the 
		first Century Build Competition.  Shylilie started things off by constructing a large, lime 
		green creeper and then encouraged players to remove blocks from the creeper until it revealed 
		her final statue, "The Faraway Tree", underneath.  Quackey958 created an unnamed statue 
		representing the elements with a distinct flavour of the Badrum Imperium.  Spaceskunks and 
		thursiya both preconstructed their designs offline so Spaceskunks' "Existence" and thursiya's 
		"Ad Astra" (out of competition due to thursiya representing the host, Operis Corporation) went 
		up very quickly.  The winner of the competition was a very tough decision, considering the 
		impressive variety of entrants, and was declared msteveharrison & Aninabanina's "Porksicle" 
		which did an exceptional job of capturing their whimsical build vision.  Participants were 
		awarded prize packages including making their marks on a forthcoming Operis Corporation 
		construction project in New Kingsburg.

	<p><b><i>Featured Build: Moon Base</i></b></p>
	<p>
		Back in November of 2013 players msteveharrison and Aninabanina were starting what would become 
		the first of many cooperatively constructed projects.  They swiftly completed the Moon Base that 
		December.  The Moon Base was one of the first structures on the server to be made with the newly 
		available stained glass and remains one of the largest structures built to date, clearly showing 
		up on all subsequent maps.  It is a good representation of an active building process, 
		incorporating various building necessities in one location (food production, mines, etc.).  When 
		it was decided that subway access was preferable, new connections were quickly built and the 
		Moon Base station helped spur the southern expansion of the subway network.  Besides 
		constructing the base they also had to level and re-cover a large chunk of land with sand to 
		give the Moon Base an appropriately lunar setting.  Make sure to check out the fountain rest 
		area, sliding "space" doors, and hidden away rooms.  The Moon Base is only reachable by subway 
		(there is no exterior access) east from Lunar Hill or south from South Shore.
