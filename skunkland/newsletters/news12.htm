					Time for the great door burning! 1.8 - "The Bountiful Update" is out and it's bringing quite a few changes. This was the longest

					- <script>wiki("Armour Stand")</script><br>
					- New food (<script>wiki("Rabbit Stew")</script>, <script>wiki("Cooked Mutton")</script> and <script>wiki("Cooked Rabbit")</script>) and

					It's been a while since we've had a regular newsletter update. Most of the work this summer can be attributed to Shylilie and Spaceskunks. 
					Shylilie has moved ahead full steam building her future capital city of Auverland, and it already includes many stately buildings. 
					Shylilie is open to other players' requests for building sites. After completing a small residential expansion on the western outskirts of 
					Delve, Spaceskunks has headed into the Swamp of Joy to build the world's first witch spawner, and then a little further south to start 
					construction of the Nordic settlement Ulve. On another break from constructing the Ottokar Fortress, thursiya has completed the Century 
					Tower condominiums in Southside New Kingsburg to celebrate the year 200. New player Quackey958 has been busy expanding the Badrum Imperium, 
					including the large, walled capital city and the village of Alf-Wy. Quackey958 has also cut a subway route from the Badrum capital all the 
					way to Braille (over 1km) and there are new connections west from Cadwgan to Jungle Tours and east from Century Build to Southside New Kingsburg.
				</p>
				<p>
					Have you missed build updates? We've got a few choice sites to show you. Clockwise from top left: Winona Mim's Hut (Ennist province, Delve); 
					Century Tower (New Kingsburg); Marshway Drive residential expansion (Delve City); Horse Track (north Faclair); Ulve downtown (Ennist province, 
					Delve); Marchelund Centre and Auverland Public Library (west Faclair); Alf-Wy (east Badrum).

				<p><b><i>New Server and World Maintenance</i></b></p>
				<p>
					On August 15th our server went down due to an error in the roll-out of MCMA's latest update (MCMA is the server control software we use that our 
					server host leases). We eventually had to solve the issue by starting a new server, but fortunately all of our world files were intact and no 
					work was lost. If you haven't done so already, please update your server info to the new address: sc26.servercraft.co:21746
				</p>
				<p>
					With the release of 1.8 there are new blocks spawned during world generation, so users have discussed the possibility of doing another world trim 
					to have closer access to the new blocks. We are looking for any input regarding this proposal (agree, disagree, possible trimlines). In the 
					absence of user input, admin will go ahead with trimming a small portion of the world map. Another issue to discuss is the possibility of nerfing 
					mob terrain damage - meaning that endermen and creepers would no longer alter the environment.
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<p><b><i>Century Build Competition</i></b></p>
				<p>
					Thanks to all of the participants who came out during the year 200 to build a statue for the first Century Build Competition. Shylilie started 
					things off by constructing a large, lime green creeper and then encouraged players to remove blocks from the creeper until it revealed her final 
					statue, "The Faraway Tree", underneath. Quackey958 created an unnamed statue representing the elements with a distinct flavour of the Badrum 
					Imperium. Spaceskunks and thursiya both preconstructed their designs offline so Spaceskunks' "Existence" and thursiya's "Ad Astra" (out of 
					competition due to thursiya representing the host, Operis Corporation) went up very quickly. The winner of the competition was a very tough 
					decision, considering the impressive variety of entrants. The winner was declared msteveharrison & Aninabanina's "Porksicle", which did an 
					exceptional job of capturing their whimsical build vision. Participants were awarded prize packages including making their marks on a forthcoming 
					Operis Corporation construction project in New Kingsburg.

				<p><b><i>Featured Build: Moon Base</i></b></p>
				<p>
					Back in November of 2013 players msteveharrison and Aninabanina were starting what would become the first of many cooperatively constructed 
					projects. They swiftly completed the Moon Base that December. The Moon Base was one of the first structures on the server to be made with the 
					newly available stained glass and remains one of the largest structures built to date, clearly showing up on all subsequent maps. It is a good 
					representation of an active building process, incorporating various building necessities in one location (food production, mines, etc). When it 
					was decided that subway access was preferable, new connections were quickly built and the Moon Base station helped spur the southern expansion 
					of the subway network. Besides constructing the base they also had to level and re-cover a large chunk of land with sand to give the Moon Base 
					an appropriately lunar setting. Make sure to check out the fountain rest area, sliding "space" doors, and hidden away rooms. The Moon Base is 
					only reachable by subway (there is no exterior access) east from Lunar Hill or south from South Shore.
