				<p class="big"><b><i>*** The New Kingsburg Monitor ***</i></b></p>
				<blockquote><i>
					Announcement: Historians, biographers, and chroniclers of Skunkland, the New Kingsburg Monitor is looking for all parties 
					with an interest in the names and places of Skunkland to contribute the lore of their land. We hope to compile it and 
					share it far and wide, in the spirit of our journalistic tradition. We are particularly looking for place names, flags 
					and other national/sub-national emblems, general demographics, and cultural information.
				</i></blockquote>
				<p>
					Our server admin finally had a day off so we get that long-awaited newsletter. We are currently in version 1.7.8, 
					presumably the final update before the big shift into 1.8 (which should finally allow players to change their names). New 
					builders have been carving out mountains and caves while a few old builders have returned and life goes on in our third 
					year in Skunkland.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our most active new builder is jaanke, who has claimed the lofty peaks southeast of the Koku Kingdom. Jaanke and nebby28 
					have constructed some fast mob-grinders for players who want to level up quickly and hopefully will share with us their 
					construction secrets. The two biggest builds in the previous months have been nebby's fortress and (unnamed) city, and 
					spaceskunks' secret tower. Spaceskunks has also expanded the borders of Delve south and finished Castle Gorllewin (with 
					its impressive, functioning portcullis). Thursiya completed the construction of the Doggy Magical headquarters in Mellon 
					Bay and has begun work on the Ottokar Fortress. Msteveharrison has moved into the eastern regions of South Shore to 
					construct the western-themed Cutter's Junction. The town of Mysteria has been renamed Braille. To help facilitate jaanke's 
					new build the subway has expanded south from the moon base to a new station in southeast Koku and east from there to 
					jaanke's base. It has also expanded north from Stellarton to Noricum.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are lots of things to see in this build roundup. Clockwise from top left: nebby's cathedral (far south of Spawn); 
					jaanke's skull entrance (southeast of Koku); cottage with pool (Braille); Doggy Magical HQ (Masovia state, Gavel); nebby's 
					homestead (far south of Spawn); Castle Gorllewin (western Delve); The Dragon's Tail Inn (eastern Crevatia); thatch roof 
					house (Cutter's Junction, South Shore); large farm (Delve); Center: New Year's fireworks (Fort Resolution, Crevatia).

				<p><b><i>New Feature: Website</i></b></p>
				<p>
					After some upgrading of CSS and Javascript skills we are proud to announce a website dedicated to this server. The site 
					features all of the newsletters, galleries, world maps, tutorials, and any other tidbits our loyal players and readers 
					think deserve to be on there. We are looking for your input to create a world section devoted to the various nations and 
					places of Skunkland. Visit the new website at: <a href="https://thursiya.github.io/skunkland">thursiya.github.io/skunkland</a>

				<p><b><i>Featured Build: Porcinia</i></b></p>
				<p>
					Porcinia, the second commune of Skunkland, was founded in 2013 by aninabanina. As a classic example of a new crafter's first 
					build the town has gone through a number of changes over its short life. The original cobblestone mining shed has been replaced 
					by a full-fledged farm and homestead, the first tower of Porcinia stands as an historical ruin already, original hardscrabble 
					farms have been replaced by a fancy auto-farm, and the town has been repopulated numerous times as its hardy pioneers face the 
					grim onslaught of the terrors of the night. The town of Porcinia is notable for a very fast initial build and for housing the 
					first exotic flowers in Skunkland. Make sure to check out Ida's Flower Shop, Porcinia Station, the new seaside homes, and 
					venture across the giant wooden bridge in the northeast to explore an old abandoned build. Porcinia can be reached by road or 
					subway east of South Shore.
