					Advertisement: Alex, I love your new coat but can you handle yourself out here in the wilds in something like that? Oh, didn't you 
					know - this is Junglewear. I've got arrow-stopping padding, clips for my survival gear, ocelot fur lining, and all with a peplum. 
					Handle?... I own the wilds! Junglewear - protective, fashionable, affordable.

					July has been busy with a few old regulars popping in for the summer and our busiest builders hard at work. We are currently running 
					version 1.8.8 (bug update) and rumour has it that version 1.9 is just around the corner. 1.9 will start to roll out features of the 
					"Combat Update" adding things like dual-wielding and enchanted arrows. And if you're looking for new blocks, an organic purple block 
					set is in the works too.

				<p>
					Thursiya is ticking off boxes on a Minecraft to-do list and for July the project was the Gavel Embassy in Crevasse, the first in a 
					series of embassies in major nations. In western Faclair Shylilie has been busy on an aggressive building regimen developing an entire 
					community along the jungle tours route, including a sizeable shopping site elevated in the trees, SkyMart. 123weedie has finally 
					returned to New Kingsburg and has nearly finished a fine home in Northside - a number of lots are still available for players looking 
					to build a home in New Kingsburg. The new Crevasse embassy also features a helicopter nether connection to the air network so travel 
					continues to improve throughout Skunkland.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are a few of the latest builds and some old favourites that haven't been featured yet. Top to bottom, left to right: Meeting Hall 
					and Frostfire Keep Embassy (Imperial City, Badrum); Wezzie's House (Braille); Palace Central Meeting Hall (Delve City); Slums of the 
					Imperial City (Badrum); Guardian Farm (Alaris province, Delve); Jungle community (western Faclair); Embassy rooftop (Crevasse); Dragon 
					bones (southwest Amahn); Gavel Embassy (Crevasse); The Golden Poppy (Alaris province, Delve); SkyMart (western Faclair).

				<p class="heading">Featured Build: Auverland</p>
				<p>
					When Shylilie announced a plan to build a large city, something much more ambitious in scale than Cadwgan, and so shortly after joining 
					the server, some players were a little incredulous. Less than a year later we have the city of Auverland, virtually built out, and a 
					top travel destination. Located just west of Endermere (itself only a little west of Cadwgan), Auverland takes up the entire 
					mountainous peninsula in the southwest of Faclair. It is home to Skunkland's second clinic, largest hotel, and first significant public 
					library, playground, and housing developments. For a very short time Auverland was even the largest city in Skunkland and is still one 
					of the largest on the server. Shylilie carefully mapped out the peninsula and planned residential, commercial, and service districts 
					after completing the first large building, the Marchelund Centre. Like many large cities it features a few builds from other players 
					and, as capital of Faclair, has space for foreign embassies to be built. Interesting fact: unlike most players' builds, the large 
					warehouse in the south of the city was actually the <i>last</i> building added to the city. Make sure you check out the wedding 
					services in the Marchelund Centre, nab the honeymoon suite in the Executive Hotel Auverland, find a nice new home from the ample 
					selection, and cap off a run through the hedge maze with a good trampoline jump in the playground! Auverland can be reached by road 
					west of Cadwgan, by subway south from Jungle Tours (west of Cadwgan), or by nether portal.
