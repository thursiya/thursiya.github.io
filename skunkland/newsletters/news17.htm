		Advertisement: Alex, I love your new coat but can you handle yourself out here in the wilds in 
		something like that?  Oh, didn't you know - this is Junglewear.  I've got arrow-stopping 
		padding, clips for my survival gear, ocelot fur lining, and all with a peplum.  Handle?... I 
		own the wilds!  Junglewear - protective, fashionable, affordable.

		July has been busy with a few old regulars popping in for the summer and our busiest builders 
		hard at work.  We are currently running version 1.8.8 (bug update) and rumour has it that 
		version 1.9 is just around the corner.  1.9 will start to roll out features of the "Combat 
		Update" adding things like dual-wielding and enchanted arrows.  And if you're looking for new 
		blocks, an organic purple block set is in the works too.

		Thursiya is ticking off boxes on a Minecraft to-do list and for July the project was the Gavel 
		Embassy in Crevasse, the first in a series of embassies in major nations.  In western Faclair 
		Shylilie has been busy on an aggressive building regimen developing an entire community along 
		the jungle tours route, including a sizable shopping site elevated in the trees, SkyMart.  
		123weedie has finally returned to New Kingsburg and has nearly finished a fine home in Northside 
		- a number of lots are still available for players looking to build a home in New Kingsburg.  
		The new Crevasse embassy also features a helicopter nether connection to the air network so 
		travel continues to improve throughout Skunkland.

		Here are a few of the latest builds and some old favourites that haven't been featured yet.  
		Top to bottom, left to right: Meeting Hall and Frostfire Keep Embassy (Imperial City, Badrum); 
		Wezzie's House (Braille); Palace Central Meeting Hall (Delve City); Slums of the Imperial City

		rooftop (Crevasse); Dragon bones (southwest Amahn); Gavel Embassy (Crevasse); The Golden Poppy

	<p><b><i>Featured Build: Auverland</i></b></p>
	<p>
		When Shylilie announced a plan to build a large city, something much more ambitious in scale 
		than Cadwgan, and so shortly after joining the server, some players were a little incredulous.  
		Less than a year later we have the city of Auverland, virtually built out, a top travel 
		destination.  Located just west of Endermere (itself only a little west of Cadwgan) Auverland 
		takes up the entire mountainous peninsula in the southwest of Faclair.  It is home to 
		Skunkland's second clinic, largest hotel, and first significant public library, playground, and 
		housing developments.  For a very short time Auverland was even the largest city in Skunkland 
		and is still one of the largest on the server.  Shylilie carefully mapped out the peninsula and 
		planned residential, commercial, and service districts after completing the first large 
		building, the Marchelund Centre.  Like many large cities it features a few builds from other 
		players and, as capital of Faclair, has space for foreign embassies to be built.  Interesting 
		fact: unlike most player's builds, the large warehouse in the south of the city was actually 
		the <i>last</i> building added to the city.  Make sure you check out the wedding services in 
		the Marchelund Centre, nab the honeymoon suite in the Executive Hotel Auverland, find a nice 
		new home from the ample selection, and cap off a run through the hedge maze with a good 
		trampoline jump in the playground!  Auverland can be reached by road west of Cadwgan, by subway 
		south from Jungle Tours (west of Cadwgan), or by nether portal.
