		Auverland, Faclair - Flooding south of Auverland!  Warm weather has brought much more water 
		than usual flowing down Portal Mountain in south Auverland causing the scenic roundabout 
		road to be washed out.  University of Ennist scientists cite global warming related to 
		massive industrialization as the likely cause while Gavel scientists dispute the notion that 
		global warming is a human-caused phenomenon stating the mountain is under-utilized as a water 
		resource.

		After the longest wait yet, it's finally here!  We are finally running version 1.9 - The 
		Combat Update!  The wait for 1.8 has been put to shame by how long we've held out for this.  
		Could this be the final major update?  Could it be that the tinkers at Mojang are busy on 
		Minecraft 2 as we speak?  As the name of the 1.9 update implies major changes include how 
		combat works and a bevy of new enchanted arrows :)<br>
		- Combat mechanics changed: sword (fast attack, sweep attack), axe (disable shields)<br>
		- <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Shield">Shields</a> and potion 
		<a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Arrow#Tipped_arrows">Tipped Arrows</a><br>
		- <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Dual_wield">Dual Wielding</a> (press F to move an 
		item/tool/shield to your off hand)<br>
		- <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Grass_Path">Grass Path</a> and 
		<a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Beetroot">Beetroot</a> (from pocket edition)<br>
		- brewing now requires blaze rod fuel<br>
		- ability to bottle <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Dragon%27s_Breath">Dragon's 
		Breath</a> (for lingering potions)<br>
		- many changes to the structure of the End (<a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/End_city">End 
		Cities & Ships</a>, infinite size)<br>
		- new End mob: <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Shulker">Shulker</a><br>
		- lots of new End blocks: <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Purpur_Block">Purpur Block</a>

		Everyone's back in town and new projects are all the rage.  Yrsyrs has returned and, with the 
		help of Nomers6, Frankerstein, and Gickitty, work has gone into upgrading and cleaning up 
		towns throughout Crevatia, in particular Anderson's Crossing and Gickerville.  Also new 
		construction is back at the Crevasse Mall and a variety of new shops have opened in the city. 
		Thursiya completed the Jupiter Mining Corporation in Zefram and took a quick break in Lunar 
		Hill to build a fish & chips restaurant.  Shylilie and Spaceskunks have teamed up to 
		construct the ice castle Lysarum in a freezing ice spikes biome discovered in the distant 
		southeast (more easily reached by rail in the nether).  Of course Shylilie's giant nether 
		fortress continues as well, growing slowly with each update.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here's a look at some of what's going on Skunkland. Top to bottom, left to right: The 
		Codpiece Fish & Chips (Lunar Hill, Ghibli province, Gavel); Anderson's Crossing (Provinces, 
		Crevatia); Jupiter Mining Corporation, Christmas Tree, Executive Hotel Zefram (Zephyr 
		province, Gavel); Gickerville Pharmacy (Frontier, Crevatia); Century Build Snowflake 
		(Zefram); Copacabana Bar (in the Jupiter Mining Corp.); Baetica Banners and Dr. Mapps 
		(Crevasse); Inside view of Lysarum Ice Castle (far southeast); Shylilie's Nether Fortress 
		(near Auverland portal); Star-Mart (Crevasse Mall).

	<p><b><i>Special Feature: Nether Map</i></b></p>
	<p>
		The nether can be a pretty daunting place, especially if you're new to Minecraft, but it 
		doesn't have to be too dangerous.  With the help of a map we can assist you in getting 
		around Skunkland faster (as movement in the nether covers 8x the distance it does in the 
		overworld).  Mapping the nether is no easy feat in game (you will find you get an ugly fuzz 
		for a map) or out of game as the many overhangs and elevations create obscured maps.  This 
		map has been created by compositing maps from various elevations in the nether to give 
		players a good look at portals, roads, and rails - this means the elevation levels change at 
		different points in the map and some features may visually cross but be significantly apart 
		on the Y-axis in game.  It should be noted that some sections, such as South Shore, Faclair, 
		and Boatmurdered, are considerably higher than others, and that the Air Travel route is 
		fully enclosed so only accessible from the appropriate overworld portals.

	<p><b><i>New Server and World Maintenance - The End</i></b></p>
	<p>
		With the release of 1.9 the world generation code has changed again.  Like 1.8 there has been 
		no change to the basic formation of the world so new chunks will physically look identical to 
		new chunks generated in 1.8 and create no "trimline" gashes in the terrain.  Unlike 1.8 there 
		are no new blocks generating in the overworld so there will be no trim of the overworld.  
		Players wanting to avoid trekking to the edges of the known world for some beets can find 
		some planted in the vegetable garden in Desert Town.  The End has been updated massively in 
		1.9 so the current plan is to completely delete The End on Saturday March 12, allowing the 
		new End dimension (and re-summonable Ender Dragon) to appear.  Any questions, concerns, or 
		comments should be directed to thursiya.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that Spaceskunks has returned "full time" we are ready to move the server to a new 
		address.  The move will take place in the following week.  The new address will be sent out 
		in an email update.
	</p>

	<p><b><i>Featured Build: Cutter's Junction</i></b></p>
	<p>
		In late 2013 Msteveharrison started work on a new settlement in South Shore, southeast of 
		the commune's eponymous city.  Cutter's Junction was constructed with a distinctively Western 
		style, incorporating a large wood palisade wall, thatch-roofed buildings, and of course a 
		saloon!  The town was also the home to one of the very first auto-farms on the server and an 
		early mob grinder design which provided gunpowder for use in the functioning cannon tower.  
		Early experiments with the cannon tower explain the quarry on the north side of town.  
		Construction mostly wrapped two years ago but while Cutter's Junction was being expanded its 
		hub was the Operations building, home to the first "slush pile" hopper-based dump-and-sort 
		and a dedicated minecart materials line.  Make sure you check out the sheep ranch, Junction 
		Bakery, stay a night at the saloon, and grab some mob drops from the bottom of the grinder.  
		Cutter's Junction can be reached by road east from South Shore City and west from the Sky 
		Gardens or by nether portal (just east in the contested zone).
