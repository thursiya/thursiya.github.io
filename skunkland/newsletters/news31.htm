		The Update Aquatic (1.13) is upon us and the world of Skunkland is now brimming with fantastic 
		populated oceans, full of plants, fish, coral and ruins! We are currently running version 1.13.1, 
		which mainly adds dead coral and has restricted <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Squid">squid</a> 
		spawning to rivers and oceans (so no more squid in lakes or artificial ponds). The Update Aquatic 
		has mostly added ocean-based changes although there are a few other important things to look out for:<br>
		- <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Underwater_ruins">underwater ruins</a> and 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Shipwreck">shipwrecks</a> full of loot, nasty 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Drowned">drowned</a>, and maps to 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Buried_treasure">buried treasure</a><br>
		- underwater <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bubble_column">bubble columns</a> that can suck 
		you under or rocket you upward<br>
		- <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coral">coral</a> (found in warm oceans) and 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coral_block">coral blocks</a> and 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coral_fan">fans</a> (plus dead varieties)<br>
		- <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Kelp">kelp</a> (harvested underwater) which can be turned 
		into <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Dried_Kelp">food</a> and 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Dried_Kelp_Block">kelp blocks</a> for fuel<br>
		- <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Seagrass">sea grass</a> and 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sea_pickle">sea pickles</a> (which also provide some light)<br>
		- <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fish_mob">schools of fish</a>, including 1000s of colourful 
		variants of new tropical fish, all of which can be <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bucket_of_Fish">caught in a bucket</a><br>
		- super slippery <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Blue_ice">blue ice</a> (and now packed ice can 
		be made from normal <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ice">ice</a>)<br>
		- new <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stripped_wood">stripped wood</a> and 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stripped_log">log</a> versions of blocks, as well as 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Button">buttons</a>, <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pressure_plate">pressure plates</a>, 
		and the much-awaited <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Trapdoor">trapdoors</a> now in all 6 wood variants<br>
		- <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Phantom">phantoms</a> (flying mobs that spawn when players don't 
		sleep) and elytra repair has been changed from leather to <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Phantom_Membrane">phantom membrane</a><br>
		- <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Turtle">turtles</a> and <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Dolphin">dolphins</a>!<br>
		- new weapon: <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Trident">trident</a> (with 4 different special enchantments)<br>
		- players can now swim (by sprinting in water) and need a little time to recover their oxygen bars when surfacing
	</p>
	<p>
		This update has also necessitated another major world trim. This time, as the update primarily 
		affected the contents of ocean biomes, we were able to regenerate most oceans with minimal signs 
		of the trim border. This trim took a very long time and we were able to trim a lot closer to the 
		shores of Crevatia and Gavel than originally thought possible. The update also completely changed 
		the way blocks are identified meaning all supporting software is now incompatible with the world 
		files and while we wait for new 1.13-compliant software builds (Minutor, in particular) there is no 
		way to properly update the world maps. And if the block IDs weren't enough, the commands in game 
		have been vastly reworked which meant that thursiya has had to spend a long time completely 
		rewriting all of the economy signs and supporting functions. On the plus side, all of these changes 
		have noticeably improved the game.

	<p>
		During the last few months SpaceSkunks (and occasionally Shylilie) has been busily adding more to 
		his new base of operations, Lumina, with some impressive new builds to be revealed soon. Shylilie 
		has upgraded the road network between Spawn and the first Century Build and Jonville. Besides a lot 
		of server work, thursiya completed the unfinished floors in the Southside Tower and is working on 
		the Enlil Museum of Modern Art at the Expo 400 site. New subway lines head southeast from Jeda 
		station to the Ottokar Fortress and south from there to Porcinia completing the subway loop around 
		the Sea of Gavel.

	<p><b><i>Alternate Spawn</i></b></p>
	<p>
		This newsletter features a map of the alternate spawn area including the desert village where players 
		will arrive, the sanctuary town of Huskguard, and some villages and biomes in the immediate 
		surroundings. Players who are interested in trying something fresher and barely explored might want 
		to check out the alternate spawn. You can reach the alternate spawn from a teleport in a stone 
		building by the main spawn Welcoming House. The alternate spawn has an area to stow items (beside the 
		teleport back) so you can have a completely fresh start in the new land. Adventurers are welcome to 
		claim a plot or empty building in the mob-free town of Huskguard to launch their expedition from.

	<p><b><i>Century Build Competition</i></b></p>
	<p>
		The Skunk Year 500 begins October 7, 2018 and goes until October 12, 2018 (this year it coincidentally 
		lines up with the week of Thanksgiving). This will be our fourth Century Build Competition and in the 
		spirit of the Update Aquatic it will be happening under water! The site for the competition is in the 
		western Boreal Ocean between the Trident in Crevatia and Anima province in Gavel but you won't have to 
		travel by boat and dive down to the site as it will be accessible by a nether access. Take the main 
		nether road by the Crevasse and New Kingsburg portals north and turn right toward The End access then 
		turn left at the sign along the road to the Expo 500 Site. The theme for the fourth Century Build is 
		"Creatures of the Deep" - we will be building an undersea, domed community and creatures around it to 
		haunt the depths of the new ocean. At the end of the competition prizes will be awarded by G-Corporation 
		to all participants and a special prize to the builder of the best "creature". We look forward to seeing 
		you beneath the waves!
