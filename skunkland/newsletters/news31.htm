					The Update Aquatic (1.13) is upon us, and the world of Skunkland is now brimming with fantastic populated oceans, full of plants, fish, coral 
					and ruins! We are currently running version 1.13.1, which mainly adds dead coral and has restricted <script>wiki("squid")</script> spawning to 
					rivers and oceans (so no more squid in lakes or artificial ponds). The Update Aquatic has mostly added ocean-based changes, although there are 
					a few other important things to look out for:<br>
					- <script>wiki("underwater ruins")</script> and <script>wiki("shipwrecks")</script> full of loot, nasty <script>wiki("drowned")</script>, and 
					maps to <script>wiki("buried treasure")</script><br>
					- underwater <script>wiki("bubble column")</script>s that can suck you under or rocket you upward<br>
					- <script>wiki("coral")</script> (found in warm oceans) and <script>wiki("coral blocks")</scripts> and <script>wiki("fans")</script> (plus dead 
					varieties)<br>
					- <script>wiki("kelp")</script> (harvested underwater) which can be turned into <script>wiki("dried kelp")</script> (food) and a 
					<script>wiki("kelp block")</script> (for fuel)<br>
					- <script>wiki("sea grass")</script> and <script>wiki("sea pickles")</script> (which also provide some light)<br>
					- schools of <script>wiki("fish")</script>, including 1000s of colourful variants of new tropical fish, all of which can be caught in a 
					<script>wiki("bucket of fish")</script><br>
					- super slippery <script>wiki("blue ice")</script> (and now packed ice can be made from normal <script>wiki("ice")</script>)<br>
					- new <script>wiki("stripped wood")</script> and <script>wiki("stripped log")</script> versions of blocks, as well as <script>wiki("buttons")</script>, 
					<script>wiki("pressure plates")</script>, and the much-awaited <script>wiki("trapdoors")</script>, now in all 6 wood variants<br>
					- <script>wiki("phantoms")</script> (flying mobs that spawn when players don't sleep), and elytra repair has been changed from leather to 
					<script>wiki("phantom membrane")</script><br>
					- <script>wiki("turtles")</script> and <script>wiki("dolphins")</script>!<br>
					- new weapon: <script>wiki("trident")</script> (with 4 different special enchantments)<br>
					- players can now swim (by sprinting in water) and need a little time to recover their oxygen bars when surfacing
				</p>
				<p>
					This update has also necessitated another major world trim. This time, as the update primarily affected the contents of ocean biomes, we were 
					able to regenerate most oceans with minimal signs of the trim border. This trim took a very long time, and we were able to trim a lot closer 
					to the shores of Crevatia and Gavel than originally thought possible. The update also completely changed the way blocks are identified, 
					meaning all supporting software is now incompatible with the world files, and while we wait for new 1.13-compliant software builds (Minutor, 
					in particular), there is no way to properly update the world maps. And if the block IDs weren't enough, the commands in game have been vastly 
					reworked, which meant that thursiya has had to spend a long time completely rewriting all of the economy signs and supporting functions. On 
					the plus side, all of these changes have noticeably improved the game.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the last few months, SpaceSkunks (and occasionally Shylilie) has been busily adding more to his new base of operations, Lumina, with 
					some impressive new builds to be revealed soon. Shylilie has upgraded the road network between Spawn and the first Century Build and Jonville. 
					Besides a lot of server work, thursiya completed the unfinished floors in the Southside Tower and is working on the Enlil Museum of Modern Art 
					at the Expo 400 site. New subway lines head southeast from Jeda station to the Ottokar Fortress and south from there to Porcinia, completing 
					the subway loop around the Sea of Gavel.

				<p class="heading">Alternate Spawn</p>
				<p>
					This newsletter features a map of the alternate spawn area, including the desert village where players will arrive, the sanctuary town of 
					Huskguard, and some villages and biomes in the immediate surroundings. Players who are interested in trying something fresher and barely 
					explored might want to check out the alternate spawn. You can reach the alternate spawn from a teleport in a stone building by the main spawn 
					Welcoming House. The alternate spawn has an area to stow items (beside the teleport back), so you can have a completely fresh start in the new 
					land. Adventurers are welcome to claim a plot or empty building in the mob-free town of Huskguard to launch their expedition from.

				<p class="heading">Century Build Competition</p>
				<p>
					The Skunk Year 500 begins October 7, 2018 and goes until October 12, 2018 (this year coincidentally lining up with the week of Thanksgiving). 
					This will be our fourth Century Build Competition, and in the spirit of the Update Aquatic, it will be happening under water! The site for the 
					competition is in the western Boreal Ocean between the Trident in Crevatia and Anima province in Gavel, but you won't have to travel by boat 
					and dive down to the site, as it will be accessible by a nether access. Take the main nether road by the Crevasse and New Kingsburg portals 
					north and turn right toward The End access, then turn left at the sign along the road to the Expo 500 Site. The theme for the fourth Century 
					Build is "Creatures of the Deep" - we will be building an undersea, domed community and creatures around it to haunt the depths of the new 
					ocean. At the end of the competition, prizes will be awarded by G-Corporation to all participants, and a special prize to the builder of the 
					best "creature". We look forward to seeing you beneath the waves!
