		It's been a long time since we've had a newsletter update and that's partly due to builders 
		busy with work and Mojang taking so long to release the new update.  Have no fear, there have 
		been great things afoot!  Spacenerds and wezzie18 started a new town project west of Delve 
		called Mysteria.  Yrsyrs completed the town of Noricum as well as Fort Resolution and is now 
		busy updating the commercial scene in Crevasse.  Kokushibyou316 has added a new point of 
		interest by the West Koku station and msteveharrison has embarked on a new project in South 
		Shore inspired by his recent travels in Spain.  With the completion of the air traffic control 
		tower and Nethair jet, the Persson International Airport is officially complete and thursiya 
		is finally moving on to new projects.  The subway network now extends to the planned Celestia 
		hub station and Thrurail corporation has built the planned connection between Gickerville and 
		Anderson's Crossing - look for massive subway expansion in Crevatia and Gavel over the next 6 
		months.

		The build examples this time stretch from one corner of the known world to the other.  Clockwise 
		from top-left: Mysteria (west of Delve); Portal to New Kingsburg (in the nether); Koku's Pacman 
		Treehouse (west Koku Kingdom); Nethair Jet at Persson Airport (west Enlil province, Gavel); Fort 
		Resolution (west-central Crevatian Dominion).  In the center: Noricum (west-central Crevatian 
		Dominion, north of Stellarton).  We've also included an updated world political map, reflecting 
		shifting borders, new subway, and even the loss of a lake to terraforming.

	<p><b><i>Featured Build: South Shore</i></b></p>
	<p>
		The long delay in newsletters deserves a sizeable featured build, so this month it's the city 
		of South Shore by msteveharrison.  Started in September 2012 as a small wharfside settlement 
		with grand ambitions, South Shore has rapidly grown to become one of the largest cities on the 
		server and the capital of the Commune of South Shore.  The city's first significant build was 
		the South Shore Inn (currently the largest hotel in the world).  Growing out from the eponymous 
		shore, a striking subway station, farming collective, row homes, resort accommodations, 
		international franchises, and capital building have been erected.  Currently msteveharrison is 
		constructing a large cathedral on the west side of the city overlooking the river.  Make sure 
		to check out the hedge maze, nuclear missile silo, and explore the narrow streets and tunnels 
		criss-crossing the city.  South Shore can be reached by subway east from Baths Palace, by road 
		east of Masovia state, or by nether portal.
