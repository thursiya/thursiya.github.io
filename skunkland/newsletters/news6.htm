					It's been a long time since we've had a newsletter update and that's partly due to builders busy with work and Mojang taking so 
					long to release the new update. Have no fear, there have been great things afoot! Spacenerds and wezzie18 started a new town 
					project west of Delve called Mysteria. Yrsyrs completed the town of Noricum as well as Fort Resolution and is now busy updating 
					the commercial scene in Crevasse. Kokushibyou316 has added a new point of interest by the West Koku station and msteveharrison 
					has embarked on a new project in South Shore inspired by his recent travels in Spain. With the completion of the air traffic 
					control tower and Nethair jet, the Persson International Airport is officially complete and thursiya is finally moving on to 
					new projects. The subway network now extends to the planned Celestia hub station and Thrurail corporation has built the planned 
					connection between Gickerville and Anderson's Crossing - look for massive subway expansion in Crevatia and Gavel over the next 6 months.
				</p>
				<p>
					The build examples this time stretch from one corner of the known world to the other. Clockwise from top-left: Mysteria (west of 
					Delve); Portal to New Kingsburg (in the nether); Koku's Pacman Treehouse (west Koku Kingdom); Nethair Jet at Persson Airport (west 
					Enlil province, Gavel); Fort Resolution (west-central Crevatian Dominion). In the center: Noricum (west-central Crevatian Dominion, 
					north of Stellarton). We've also included an updated world political map, reflecting shifting borders, new subway, and even the 
					loss of a lake to terraforming.

				<p><b><i>Featured Build: South Shore</i></b></p>
				<p>
					The long delay in newsletters deserves a sizeable featured build, so this month it's the city of South Shore by msteveharrison. 
					Started in September 2012 as a small wharfside settlement with grand ambitions, South Shore has rapidly grown to become one of 
					the largest cities on the server and the capital of the Commune of South Shore. The city's first significant build was the South 
					Shore Inn (currently the largest hotel in the world). Growing out from the eponymous shore, a striking subway station, farming 
					collective, row homes, resort accommodations, international franchises, and capital building have been erected. Currently 
					msteveharrison is constructing a large cathedral on the west side of the city overlooking the river. Make sure to check out the 
					hedge maze, nuclear missile silo, and explore the narrow streets and tunnels criss-crossing the city. South Shore can be reached 
					by subway east from Baths Palace, by road east of Masovia state, or by nether portal.
