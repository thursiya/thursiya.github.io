					Warm days are (occasionally) upon us, summer is almost here, and Skunkland is brimming with activity. We are currently in 
					version 1.7.9 and eagerly await the big release of 1.8. Thank you to all those players who have taken the time to pass on 
					information for the website's world section. The website is being regularly updated with new information and pictures, so go 
					check it out at <a href="https://thursiya.github.io/skunkland">thursiya.github.io/skunkland</a> . Thank you also to those 
					players who have shared the names of the places in their lands - all of this information is being collected for the eagerly 
					awaited new political map, planned for release next month (continuing our semiannual release tradition).
				</p>
				<p>
					We welcome a number of new builders, in particular, Shylilie, who has founded the Freenation of Faclair (part of the Tseles 
					Protectorate with Delve and Braille), and Jehkoba, who is busy constructing Dragon Ridge south of Sofia. Shylilie has already 
					founded two towns, Cadwgan and Endermere, and is starting work on a third. SpaceSkunks has been very busy upgrading Delve 
					City, adding housing, and has completed external construction on the towering University of Ennist. Thursiya took a break 
					from the Ottokar Fortress to build an official residence in Crevatia, Ambassador House. Jaanke completed a large desert 
					subway station for Lut Gholein. Msteveharrison and Aninabanina have teamed up for another large project, this one a giant 
					floating island in Porcinia with a rainbow bridging from it to the ground. Nebby28's Unnamed City continues to grow and the 
					skeleton of a curious massive tower has appeared in Braille. The subway network has grown significantly with new connections 
					to Lut Gholein (South from Boatmurdered and South from SE Koku), Sofia (West from Lut Gholein), and Dragon Ridge (South from 
					Sofia). The Delve and Braille stations have been upgraded into full switching stations and Braille now has a south connection 
					to Cadwgan.
				</p>
				<p>
					Big new projects dot our build examples image. Clockwise from top left: The Braille Fountain; Rhonda's Clear Water Cafe (Delve 
					City); Dragon Ridge (south of Sofia); Ambassador House (Crevasse); The Unnamed City Fortress (Aiur); Endermere (Faclair); 
					University of Ennist (Ennist province, Delve); Crevasse Mall Food Court; Center: Rainbow (Porcinia).

				<p><b><i>Server World Input Needed</i></b></p>
				<p>
					Minecraft version 1.8 is believed to be just around the corner (the exact release date is still unknown). 1.8 will add some new 
					stone/ore blocks to the world and will almost definitely cause the terrain generation to be altered again. This means that after 
					we upgrade to 1.8 all newly explored terrain will have the blocks and will generate based on a different code so you will notice 
					big terrain shifts, like the trim lines. This has happened every time the terrain generation code is upgraded and we usually 
					trim the world at that time to allow players faster access to the new terrain. Assuming the code is changed, we are planning to 
					trim the world again after 1.8 is released, and we would like to know which parts of the map you want to maintain in the old 
					terrain. In the absence of player responses all builds will be maintained and the outlying terrain will be trimmed according to 
					the admin's discretion.
				</p>

				<p><b><i>Featured Build: Fort Resolution</i></b></p>
				<p>
					Fort Resolution was built by yrsyrs over a few months in mid-2013. The first castle in Crevatia, it stands guard over Evermoor 
					swamp, a western border of Crevatia. The fort was built onto a large hill overlooking the swamp so the topmost portions of the 
					fort are more complete than lower sections that dig roots into the hill. After ascending the fort's zigzagging entrance stair 
					you will find a grand quartz gate leading to a large courtyard. The courtyard is flanked by an ice tower and fire tower (housing 
					enchanting equipment) and contains a Tolkien-esque white tree, access to kitchens, forge, and 'invisible floor' library. Fort 
					Resolution played host to the 2013 New Year's fireworks display, its high battlements offering views level with some of the 
					fireworks! Make sure to check out the fort's many secret entrances and the sumptuous Red Dragon Inn at the base of the fort. 
					Fort Resolution can be reached by road north of Noricum or northwest of Anderson's Crossing or through nether portal (found in 
					the nether fortress).
