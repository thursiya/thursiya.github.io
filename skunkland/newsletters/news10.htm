		Announcement: The years roll on in Skunkland but watchful citizens know that the year 200 is 
		fast approaching.  To celebrate the beginning of the third century of Skunk Years the 
		Government of Gavel and the Operis Corporation are sponsoring the Century Build Competition.  
		The theme will be Architects of the Future.  More to come!

		Warm days are (occasionally) upon us, summer is almost here, and Skunkland is brimming with 
		activity.  We are currently in version 1.7.9 and eagerly await the big release of 1.8.  Thank 
		you to all of those players who have taken the time to pass on information for the website's 
		world section.  The website is being regularly updated with new information and pictures, so 
		go check it out at <a href="../index.htm">http://web.uvic.ca/~thursiya/minecraft</a> .  Thank 
		you also to those players who have shared the names of the places in their lands - all of this 
		information is being collected for the eagerly awaited new political map, planned for release 
		next month (continuing our semiannual release tradition).

		We welcome a number of new builders, in particular, Shylilie, who has founded the Freenation 
		of Faclair (part of the Tseles Protectorate with Delve and Braille), and Jehkoba, who is busy 
		constructing Dragon Ridge south of Sofia.  Shylilie has already founded two towns, Cadwgan and 
		Endermere, and is starting work on a third.  SpaceSkunks has been very busy upgrading Delve 
		City, adding housing, and has completed external construction on the towering University of 
		Ennist.  Thursiya took a break from the Ottokar Fortress to build an official residence in 
		Crevatia, Ambassador House.  Jaanke completed a large desert subway station for Lut Gholein.  
		Msteveharrison and Aninabanina have teamed up for another large project, this one a giant 
		floating island in Porcinia with a rainbow bridging from it to the ground.  Nebby28's Unnamed 
		City continues to grow and the skeleton of a curious massive tower has appeared in Braille.  
		The subway network has grown significantly with new connections to Lut Gholein (South from 
		Boatmurdered and South from SE Koku), Sofia (West from Lut Gholein), and Dragon Ridge (South 
		from Sofia).  The Delve and Braille stations have been upgraded into full switching stations 
		and Braille now has a south connection to Cadwgan.

	<p><b><i>Server World Input Needed</i></b></p>
	<p>
		Minecraft version 1.8 is believed to be just around the corner (the exact release date is still 
		unknown).  1.8 will add some new stone/ore blocks to the world and will almost definitely cause 
		the terrain generation to be altered again.  This means that after we upgrade to 1.8 all newly 
		explored terrain will have the blocks and will generate based on a different code so you will 
		notice big terrain shifts, like the trim lines.  This has happened every time the terrain 
		generation code is upgraded and we usually trim the world at that time to allow players faster 
		access to the new terrain.  Assuming the code is changed, we are planning to trim the world 
		again after 1.8 is released and we would like to know which parts of the map you want to 
		maintain in the old terrain.  In place of player responses all builds will be maintained and 
		the outlying terrain will be trimmed according to the admin's discretion.

	<p><b><i>Featured Build: Fort Resolution</i></b></p>
	<p>
		Fort Resolution was built by yrsyrs over a few months in mid-2013.  The first castle in 
		Crevatia it stands guard over Evermoor swamp, a western border of Crevatia.  The fort was built 
		onto a large hill overlooking the swamp so the topmost portions of the fort are more complete 
		than lower sections that dig roots into the hill.  After ascending the fort's zigzagging 
		entrance stair you will find a grand quartz gate leading to a large courtyard.  The courtyard 
		is flanked by an ice tower and fire tower (housing enchanting equipment) and contains a 
		Tolkien-esque white tree, access to kitchens, forge, and 'invisible floor' library.  Fort 
		Resolution played host to the 2013 New Year's fireworks display, its high battlements offering 
		views level with some of the fireworks!  Make sure to check out the fort's many secret 
		entrances and the sumptuous Red Dragon Inn at the base of the fort.  Fort Resolution can be 
		reached by road north of Noricum or northwest of Anderson's Crossing or through nether portal 
		(found in the nether fortress).
