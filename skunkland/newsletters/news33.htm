				<blockquote>
					Delve City, Delve - The first phase of the redevelopment of central Delve City is complete. Long ago a bustling little market was the heart 
					of Delve, but it was later abandoned and levelled due to gentrification and the movement of large commerce to the western suburb. Recently, 
					Delve Co. central management commissioned international developers to gut the basement of the city and redevelop it into a major commercial 
					hub. Applications are now being taken for businesses interested in setting up shop in the second phase.

					We are currently running version 1.14.4, a few minor updates into the Village & Pillage update. If you haven't been on since 1.14 then the 
					biggest difference you'll notice is in villagers - they now come in 13 job and 7 biome varieties, work at particular tool stations, sleep 
					in beds, and generally follow a more ordered schedule. Things to know about 1.14:<br>
					- new interactive blocks that serve as work sites for villagers including: <script>wiki("barrels")</script> (storage chest that can be 
					angled up or to the side), <script>wiki("blast furnace")</script> (faster smelting), <script>wiki("cartography table")</script> (lets you 
					clone and lock maps), <script>wiki("composter")</script> (turn organic matter into bone meal - finally a use for all those extra seeds!), 
					<script>wiki("grindstone")</script>, <script>wiki("lectern")</script>, <script>wiki("loom")</script> (far more efficient banner creation), 
					<script>wiki("smoker")</script> (faster cooking), and <script>wiki("stonecutter")</script>. The <script>wiki("fletching table")</script> 
					and <script>wiki("smithing table")</script> currently have no player use.<br>
					- <script>wiki("bamboo")</script> (can be planted, used as a fuel, or made into <script>wiki("scaffolding")</script>)<br>
					- <script>wiki("signs")</script> now come in all 6 wood varieties<br>
					- more slabs, stairs, and wall varieties available (including - finally - stone slabs and stairs!)<br>
					- <script>wiki("campfires")</script>, <script>wiki("lanterns")</script>, and <script>wiki("crossbows")</script>!<br>
					- dyeing things now requires coloured <script>wiki("dyes")</script>, so bone meal needs to be turned into white dye before it can dye 
					something white, ink into black dye, cocoa beans into brown, etc.<br>
					- a <script>wiki("wandering trader")</script> with a couple llamas can appear from time to time offering unique random trades<br>
					- cats are now distinct from ocelots and come in more varieties, plus <script>wiki("pandas")</script> and <script>wiki("foxes")</script>!<br>
					- it's now possible to trigger a <script>wiki("raid")</script> on a village: if you have killed the leader of an <script>wiki("illager patrol")</script> 
					you will gain the <script>wiki("bad omen")</script> status effect and entering a village will cause waves of nasty illagers to attack the 
					village, so be careful!

					During the last year we've seen sporadic bursts of building energy. Spaceskunks had limited internet connection but managed to complete The 
					White Swan Inn, a variety of colourful storefronts in Lumina, and the structure of the Tseles Bank building in New Kingsburg. Wanderlust 
					drove Shylilie west to found new settlements, currently with a subway connection heading west from Sartori and a meandering road to the 
					furthest settlement area, Orne. Shylilie also gutted the basement of Delve City (with Spaceskunks' blessing) to redevelop it as a market 
					then worked with Spaceskunks to build the Tseles Bank location in New Kingsburg. Thursiya coded 2 "smartphone" games into the server 
					(Stellar Command and Codebreaker) then finished the underground mall in New Kingsburg with a brief break to build Shylilie's Century Build 
					prize, a Mr. Tsai's restaurant in Sartori.

					site); Delve Co. Department Store & Tseles Bank Regional HQ (New Kingsburg); The White Swan Inn (Lumina); bridge on the road to Orne (west 
					of Faclair); Delve Market Redevelopment (Delve City); Mr. Tsai's Chow Mein Palace (Sartori, Faclair); back of G-Corporation Skyfarm (just 
					east of Auverland); map of Crevatia (inside Hometree, Crevasse City); Capitol Centre Mall (New Kingsburg).

				<p class="heading">Skyscrapers of Skunkland</p>
				<p>
					The first Skyscrapers of Skunkland contest wrapped at the beginning of the year, and Spaceskunks' Tseles Bank Headquarters (with highest 
					hot tub in the world) was declared the winner. Spaceskunks graciously ceded victory rights to thursiya's very organically themed 
					G-Corporation Skyfarm Research Facility (with highest auto-farm).

					The second Skyscrapers of Skunkland contest will take place at the Nexus build site (future capital of Gavel), which is accessible by 
					subway north from the Persson International Airport or at the north end of the Gavel Highway. Building spots will be set aside. This 
					year's theme is "Patriotic Pride", and the contest runs from December 4, 2019 to January 2, 2020. Each build will be a skyscraper 
					embassy for your nation and should feature your national colours and symbols in a tasteful way. Skyscrapers must have a minimum of 7 
					floors and a maximum altitude of Y: 124 (with only small details allowed above that height). Players must bring their own supplies, but a 
					home base with Ender Chest and basic supplies to get each player started will be provided. All participants will receive an award for 
					their builds, and a special prize will be awarded to the builder who best captures the theme "Patriotic Pride". The grand prize winner 
					will also get to choose the next build site and location. As evidenced by last year's contest entries, it's time to start thinking 
					creatively about the shape and layout of your skyscraper!
