		Delve City, Delve - The first phase of the redevelopment of central Delve City is complete. Long ago a 
		bustling little market was the heart of Delve but it was later abandoned and levelled due to gentrification 
		and the movement of large commerce to the western suburb. Recently Delve Co. central management commissioned 
		international developers to gut the basement of the city and redevelop it into a major commercial hub. 
		Applications are now being taken for businesses interested in setting up shop in the second phase.

		We are currently running version 1.14.4, a few minor updates into the Village & Pillage update. If you 
		haven't been on since 1.14 then the biggest difference you'll notice is in villagers - they now come in 13 
		job and 7 biome varieties, work at particular tool stations, sleep in beds, and generally follow a more 
		ordered schedule. Things to know about 1.14:<br>
		- new interactive blocks that serve as work sites for villagers including: 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Barrel">barrels</a> (storage chest that can be angled up or to the side), 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Blast_furnace">blast furnace</a> (faster smelting), 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Cartography_table">cartography table</a> (lets you clone and lock maps), 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Composter">composter</a> (turn organic matter into bone meal - finally a 
		use for all those extra seeds!), <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Grindstone">grindstone</a>, 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lectern">lectern</a>, <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Loom">loom</a> 
		(far more efficient banner creation), <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Smoker">smoker</a> (faster cooking), 
		and <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stonecutter">stonecutter</a>. The 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fletching_table">fletching table</a> and 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Smithing_Table">smithing table</a> currently have no player use.<br>
		- <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bamboo">bamboo</a> (can be planted, used as a fuel, or made into 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Scaffolding">scaffolding</a>)<br>
		- <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sign">signs</a> now come in all 6 wood varieties<br>

		- <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Campfire">campfires</a>, 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lantern">lanterns</a>, and 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Crossbow">crossbows</a>!<br>
		- <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Dye">dyeing things</a> now requires coloured dyes, so bone meal needs 
		to be turned into white dye before it can dye something, ink into black dye, cocoa beans into brown, etc.<br>
		- a <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wandering_trader">wandering trader</a> with a couple llamas can appear 
		from time to time offering unique random trades<br>
		- cats are now distinct from ocelots and come in more varieties, plus 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Panda">pandas</a> and 
		<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fox">foxes</a>!<br>
		- it's now possible to trigger a <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Raid">raid on a village</a>: if you have 
		killed the leader of an <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Illager_patrol">illager patrol</a> you will gain 
		the <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bad_Omen">bad omen</a> status effect and entering a village will cause 
		waves of nasty illagers to attack the village, so be careful!

		During the last year we've seen sporadic bursts of building energy. Spaceskunks had limited internet 
		connection but managed to complete The White Swan Inn and a variety of colourful storefronts in Lumina, 
		and the structure of the Tseles Bank building in New Kingsburg. Wanderlust drove Shylilie west to found 
		new settlements, currently with a subway connection heading west from Sartori and a meandering road to the 
		furthest settlement area, Orne. Shylilie also gutted the basement of Delve City (with Spaceskunks' blessing) 
		to redevelop it as a market then worked with Spaceskunks to build the Tseles Bank location in New Kingsburg. 
		Thursiya coded 2 "smartphone" games into the server (Stellar Command and Codebreaker) then finished the 
		underground mall in New Kingsburg with a brief break to build Shylilie's Century Build prize, a Mr. Tsai's 
		restaurant in Sartori.

	<p><b><i>Skyscrapers of Skunkland</i></b></p>
	<p>
		The first Skyscrapers of Skunkland contest wrapped at the beginning of the year and Spaceskunks' Tseles 
		Bank Headquarters (with highest hot tub in the world) was declared the winner. Spaceskunks graciously 
		ceded victory rights to thursiya's very organically themed G-Corporation Skyfarm Research Facility (with 
		highest auto-farm).

		The second Skyscrapers of Skunkland contest will take place at the Nexus build site (future capital of 
		Gavel), which is accessible by subway north from the Persson International Airport or at the north end 
		of the Gavel Highway. Building spots will be set aside. This year's theme is "Patriotic Pride" and the 
		contest runs from December 4, 2019 to January 2, 2020. Each build will be a skyscraper embassy for your 
		nation and should feature your national colours and symbols in a tasteful way. Skyscrapers must have a 
		minimum of 7 floors and a maximum altitude of Y: 124 (with only small details allowed above that height). 
		Players must bring their own supplies but a home base with Ender Chest and basic supplies to get each 
		player started will be provided. All participants will receive an award for their builds and a special 
		prize will be awarded to the builder who best captures the theme "Patriotic Pride". The grand prize winner 
		will also get to choose the next build site and location. As evidenced by last year's contest entries it's 
		time to start thinking creatively about the shape and layout of your skyscraper!
