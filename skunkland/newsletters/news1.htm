		This month we've included an up to date political map of the server world.  New players will 
		notice that the large, restricted "national" builds are spread around the north of spawn, so 
		there are plenty of opportunities for those who venture south.  Old (and new) players may wish 
		to suggest corrections to boundaries and discuss naming of natural features.  The smaller areas 
		outlined in purple are miscellaneous (unnamed) build areas, with the exception of the region 
		just south of Desert Town (Mount Pacifica) which will house the forthcoming "League of Nations" 
		international meeting place.  I've also included a combo-photo of example builds, this one 
		featuring (clockwise from top left) the C&C's B&B near Space Town (by yrsyrs), Operis Corporate 
		Tower (by thursiya), "Hope's Dream" Yacht (by yrsyrs), and the entrance to Delve (by spaceskunks).

	<p>
		With the temporary retirement of Spaceskunks, it is now time to consider changing the server 
		world name "Skunkland" to something new.  Please send in your suggestions for a new name!
	</p>
	<br>
	<p><b><i>Featured Build: Delve</i></b></p>
	<p>
		This month's featured build is Delve by Spaceskunks.  Delve is the oldest serious build 
		started in Skunkland, under continuous construction from January 2012 to the present.  Planned 
		as a large encircling wall with an underground city, the city has gone through a few changes 
		since its foundation, at one time housing a subway terminus (now found on the outskirts), and 
		for a short time maintaining a giant tree in the center of the surface floor.  The city is 
		currently about half hollowed out and about a quarter complete.  Make sure to check out the 
		giant Delve HQ (Delve.jpg), Apothecary, Portal, Delvion Bank, and the impressive Dragon 
		Entrance.  Delve can be reached via subway (west from Desert Town), by heading west up the 
		Spawn River, by road southwest of Desert Town or west through Space Town, or by nether portal.
