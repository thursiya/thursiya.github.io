					This month we've included an up to date political map of the server world. New players will notice that the large, 
					restricted "national" builds are spread around the north of spawn, so there are plenty of opportunities for those 
					who venture south. Old (and new) players may wish to suggest corrections to boundaries and discuss naming of natural 
					features. The smaller areas outlined in purple are miscellaneous (unnamed) build areas, with the exception of the 
					region just south of Desert Town (Mount Pacifica) which will house the forthcoming "League of Nations" international 
					meeting place. We've also included a combo-photo of example builds, this one featuring (clockwise from top left) the 
					C&C's B&B near Space Town (by yrsyrs), Operis Corporate Tower (by thursiya), "Hope's Dream" Yacht (by yrsyrs), and 
					the entrance to Delve (by spaceskunks).

				<p><b><i>Player Input Needed</i></b></p>
				<p>
					With the temporary retirement of Spaceskunks, it is now time to consider changing the server world name "Skunkland" 
					to something new. Please send in your suggestions for a new name!
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<p><b><i>Featured Build: Delve</i></b></p>
				<p>
					This month's featured build is Delve by Spaceskunks. Delve is the oldest serious build started in Skunkland, under 
					continuous construction from January 2012 to the present. Planned as a large encircling wall with an underground city, 
					the city has gone through a few changes since its foundation, at one time housing a subway terminus (now found on the 
					outskirts), and for a short time maintaining a giant tree in the center of the surface floor. The city is currently 
					about half hollowed out and about a quarter complete. Make sure to check out the giant Delve HQ, Apothecary, Portal, 
					Delvion Bank, and the impressive Dragon Entrance. Delve can be reached via subway (west from Desert Town), by heading 
					west up the Spawn River, by road southwest of Desert Town or west through Space Town, or by nether portal.
