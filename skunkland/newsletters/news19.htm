					Another newsletter running version 1.8.8; Jeb has confirmed that 1.9 will not be released in 2015 to make sure that servers run smoothly 
					over the holidays. Which means smooth sailing for our second Century Build Competition.
				</p>
				<p>
					Everyone's been quietly prepping for the big date. Quackey958 continues work on secret projects yet to be revealed. Spaceskunks continues 
					showing up and completing things although technically still being unavailable. Rumour has it Spaceskunks even plans a "write-in" entry to 
					the Century Build Competition - so if it sounds like you might not make the big date, you can try sending something in to thursiya (pics, 
					plans, world files, etc.) to be included. More construction is happening in Cirrus: this time Shylilie's building on the east side by 
					the Jungle Tours entrance - spot those flashy new homes! Thursiya has taken a break from New Kingsburg additions to build the town of 
					Zefram in the midst of Zephyr province, just east of the Zephyr Prison. Zefram's already sporting a variety of buildings and its very own 
					JavaBeans, plus it will play host to the Year 300 Century Build Competition. This means the subway has expanded east from Zephyr Prison 
					and west from Celestia to the new Zefram Station. Also, the above-ground line between the Imperial City and Alf-Wy has been connected to 
					the Imperial City station.
				</p>

					Here's a snapshot of life in Skunkland. Some things we've been working on and special bits from the past. Top to bottom, left to right: 
					Zefram (Zephyr province, Gavel); 301 Northside Plaza (New Kingsburg); below: Woodcutter's Hut (south of William's Harbour, Crevatia); 
					West gate of the Unnamed City (Aiur); Row Homes (east Cirrus, Faclair); Zefram Greenhouse (Gavel); Southside G-Mart (New Kingsburg); 
					Temple of Destinia (Slums of the Imperial City, Badrum); Zombie Apocalypse Training (near Lone Tree Mine); Nether Hub (near Crevasse 
					portal); West gate of Delve.

				<p class="heading">Century Build Competition</p>
				<p>
					It's that time of year (and a half) again: Skunk Year 300 begins December 26, 2015 and goes until December 31. That means by happy 
					coincidence the Year 300 Century Build Competition will fall between Christmas and New Year's Eve. To celebrate come out to the new 
					town of Zefram (Zephyr province, Gavel - take subway west from Celestia or east from Zephyr Prison) and take part in the Century Build 
					Competition 300. The theme of the competition is "Building Together" - the three planned builds are all cooperative! First off, there's 
					the snowflake plaza; bring 10-20 coloured blocks (flat top, in groups of 8) to fill in part of a shard of the snowflake, then store 
					your 7 leftover groups in the pavilion for the final product - they will be placed to make a kaleidoscopic snowflake. Second is the 
					totem at the centre of the snowflake; build one layer of the totem (4m high, up to 5m x 5m width) using whatever blocks you like and 
					other players will add layers on top of yours. Third is the Collaboration House; choose one of the six available building areas (main 
					floor kitchen, main floor living, upper floor left, upper floor right, attic, or basement) and build what you feel is necessary for the 
					space - the frame of the house is just a guide and players can be as creative as they like building in or out of the bounds. Lastly, 
					for those who just can't get enough of special events, there are some spaces around the snowflake available for players to build 
					whatever they like to celebrate the century. So do one if you can or try to do all four! The contest closes at midnight New Year's Eve 
					(December 31, 2015). There is a nether chest in the Century Build Pavilion, plus a mine (Jupiter Mining Company), snow farm, food, 
					wool, and hotel on site. At the conclusion of the competition prizes (both blocks/items and intangibles) will be awarded by the Doggy 
					Magical Corporation to all participants and for the best efforts. So just two weeks left to gather your goodies!

				<p class="heading">New Feature: Current Player Projects Page</p>
				<p>
					Due to player requests a page has been added to the website that features current build projects for various players (and some future 
					plans). The page has an embedded Google Doc that players can edit to update their building plans. If you would like access to editing 
					the page please contact thursiya. The new projects page can be accessed from the World page or from <a href="../world/projects.htm">this link</a>.
				</p>

				<p class="heading">Featured Build: Imperial City of Badrum</p>
				<p>
					Built around the site of Quackey958's first settlement, the Imperial City is the centre of the Imperium of Badrum. In the middle of the 
					city sits the grand meeting hall where representatives of the six parts of the empire convene. Around the meeting hall are a variety of 
					embassies from every corner of the empire and various temples to the many gods worshipped by Imperial Citizens, including one temple 
					that serves as a stunning nether portal to the city. On the west side of the Imperial City lies the Imperial Palace, built on the site 
					of the original settlement; it has been undergoing construction and renovations since the foundation of the city and remains partly 
					complete. Venturing to the south of the city you will find Badrum's chief port, bringing in goods from nations of the east, and the 
					city's darker side: a sprawling slums district supplying the work force and the majority of the population. Make sure you check out 
					some of the strange rooms in the Imperial Palace, the dangerous back alleys of the slums, and the day clock (next to the Century Hour 
					Glass). The Imperial City can be reached by road north then west from Alf-Wy, by subway west from Braille, or by nether portal.
