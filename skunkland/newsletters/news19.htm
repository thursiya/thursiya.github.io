		Another newsletter running version 1.8.8; Jeb has confirmed that 1.9 will not be 
		released in 2015 to make sure that servers run smoothly over the holidays.  Which 
		means smooth sailing for our second Century Build Competition.
	</p>
	<p>
		Everyone's been quietly prepping for the big date.  Quackey958 continues work on 
		secret projects yet to be revealed.  Spaceskunks continues showing up and completing 
		things although technically still being unavailable.  Rumour has it Spaceskunks even 
		plans a "write-in" entry to the Century Build Competition - so if it sounds like you 
		might not make the big date you can try sending something in to thursiya (pics, 
		plans, world files, etc.) to be included.  More construction is happening in Cirrus, 
		this time Shylilie's building on the east side by the Jungle Tours entrance - spot 
		those flashy new homes!  Thursiya has taken a break from New Kingsburg additions to 
		build the town of Zefram in the midst of Zephyr province, just east of the Zephyr 
		Prison - Zefram's already sporting a variety of buildings and its very own JavaBeans, 
		plus it will play host to the Year 300 Century Build Competition.  This means the 
		subway has expanded east from Zephyr Prison and west from Celestia to the new Zefram 
		Station.  Also, the above-ground line between the Imperial City and Alf-Wy has been 
		connected to the Imperial City station.

	<p><b><i>Century Build Competition</i></b></p>
	<p>
		It's that time of year (and a half) again: Skunk Year 300 begins December 26, 2015 
		and goes until December 31.  That means by happy coincidence the Year 300 Century 
		Build Competition will fall between Christmas and New Year's Eve.  To celebrate 
		come out to the new town of Zefram (Zephyr province, Gavel - take subway west from 
		Celestia or east from Zephyr Prison) and take part in the Century Build Competition 
		300.  The theme of the competition is "Building Together" - the three planned 
		builds are all cooperative!  First off there's the snowflake plaza; bring 10-20 
		coloured blocks (flat top, in groups of 8) to fill in part of a shard of the 
		snowflake, then store your 7 leftover groups in the pavilion for the final product 
		- they will be placed to make a kaleidoscopic snowflake.  Second is the totem at the 
		centre of the snowflake; build one layer of the totem (4m high, up to 5m x 5m width) 
		using whatever blocks you like and other players will add layers on top of yours.  
		Third is the Collaboration House; choose one of the six available building areas 
		(main floor kitchen, main floor living, upper floor left, upper floor right, attic, 
		or basement) and build what you feel is necessary for the space - the frame of the 
		house is just a guide and players can be as creative as they like building in or out 
		of the bounds.  Lastly, for those who just can't get enough of special events, there 
		are some spaces around the snowflake available for players to build whatever they 
		like to celebrate the century.  So do one if you can or try to do all four!  The 
		contest closes at midnight New Year's Eve (December 31, 2015).  There is a nether 
		chest in the Century Build Pavilion, plus a mine (Jupiter Mining Company), snow 
		farm, food, wool, and hotel on site.  At the conclusion of the competition prizes 
		(both blocks/items and intangibles) will be awarded by the Doggy Magical Corporation 
		to all participants and for the best efforts.  So just two weeks left to gather your 
		goodies!

	<p><b><i>New Feature: Current Player Projects Page</i></b></p>
	<p>
		Due to player requests a page has been added to the website that features current 
		build projects for various players (and some future plans).  The page has an 
		embedded Google Doc that players can edit to update their building plans.  If you 
		would like access to editing the page please contact thursiya.  The new projects 
		page can be accessed from the World page or from 
		<a href="../world/projects.htm">this link</a>.

	<p><b><i>Featured Build: Imperial City of Badrum</i></b></p>
	<p>
		Built around the site of Quackey958's first settlement, the Imperial City is the 
		centre of the Imperium of Badrum.  In the middle of the city sits the grand meeting 
		hall where representatives of the six parts of the empire convene.  Around the 
		meeting hall are a variety of embassies from every corner of the empire and various 
		temples to the many gods worshipped by Imperial Citizens, including one temple that 
		serves as a stunning nether portal to the city.  On the west side of the Imperial 
		City lies the Imperial Palace, built on the site of the original settlement - it has 
		been undergoing construction and renovations since the foundation of the city and 
		remains partly complete.  Venturing to the south of the city you will find Badrum's 
		chief port, bringing in goods from nations of the east, and the city's darker side: 
		a sprawling slums district supplying the work force and the majority of the 
		population.  Make sure you check out some of the strange rooms in the Imperial 
		Palace, the dangerous back alleys of the slums, and the day clock (next to the 
		Century Hour Glass).  The Imperial City can be reached by road north then west from 
		Alf-Wy, by subway west from Braille, or by nether portal.
