		To think the summer is already half over... and we're almost halfway to the next Century 
		Build.  We are currently running version 1.10.2 - so nothing new and extremely minor bug 
		fixes you probably never ran into... unless you tried to go near Desert Town in 1.10.1 and 
		found the client crashed every time it loaded (minor bug that).

		Over the summer Shylilie has again been our most prolific builder with most of that 
		construction happening in Patria (and some with assistance from SpaceSkunks).  Besides the 
		flashy new subway station there's also Poorrot's restaurant, a new set of swanky row homes, 
		and a large banking branch for the Tseles Bank of Commerce.  SpaceSkunks continues to add to 
		the Delve International Airport with the construction of a giant airship and also fit in a 
		giant enderman grinder in The End - now the fastest place to build up xp and collect ender 
		pearls.  Thursiya has mostly been involved with one big project, the Bank of Gavel Western 
		Headquarters just outside of Delve.  Dropkickz' additions are mostly subtractions under the 
		earth in the Far East and yrsyrs has been busy helping some of the new young builders 
		acclimatize to life in Crevatia.  The subway now goes south from Auverland to a secondary 
		Auverland station: Auverland Market.  The two Auverland stations now go east to the new West 
		Patria station which goes north to Cadwgan.

		Here are some of the latest things to see in Skunkland this summer.  Top to bottom, left to 
		right: Shallow Bend Cattle Ranch (north of Cutter's Junction, South Shore); Endless "strip 
		mining" (Far East); Horse Track (northwest Cadwgan); New office district (Crevasse); 
		Poorrot's Restaurant (Patria, Faclair); Bank of Gavel Western HQ & Airship in background 
		(Delve City); West Patria Subway Station (Faclair); Cathedral (The Unnamed City, Aiur); Row 
		Homes (Patria, Faclair); Main Vault of the Bank of Gavel Western HQ (Delve City).

	<p><b><i>Specialty Images</i></b></p>
	<p>
		You've probably spotted the lustrous, detailed images on ATMs around Skunkland and you may 
		have even seen the Pachinko boards in a Doggy Magical.  You're thinking, "I wonder how you 
		get that painting?" but don't be fooled!  These specialty images are actually maps, garden 
		variety maps placed on item frames.  It turns out that by manipulating the surface of terrain 
		over a specific 128x128 section of map you can create custom maps to look like pretty much 
		anything, with a much higher resolution than the average block shows.  Of course all of that 
		surface manipulation would take ages so players would probably prefer to just get it added.  
		Well now you can do that, just submit a (roughly) square image (or set of images as maps can 
		be tiled) to thursiya and we'll attempt to create a specialty map for you that can be placed 
		in frames (and copied).  Choose something you think would be useful to represent in more 
		detail in a number of locations.

	<p><b><i>Featured Build: The Unnamed City</i></b></p>
	<p>
		When nebby28 joined the server he set out on a mission: build a giant medieval city far from 
		civilization.  And that's just what you'll find in The Unnamed City, center of the Kingdom of 
		Aiur.  The first settlement in the kingdom was on top of the bluff overlooking the south 
		Austral Ocean.  Soon construction moved south to the mainland and the natural harbour which 
		was transformed into a small fishing port with a few picturesque cottages.  While a sizable 
		storage/processing area and mine developed beneath one of the cottages a massive sandstone 
		fortress rose up to form the core of the future city.  Although nebby originally built a 
		bedrock rail all the way from Aiur to Crevatia, he wisely opted for a shorter nether route 
		accessed through portals in the giant cathedral.  The construction of the city seems to have 
		ceased and empty homes sit missing their final window panes or any furniture while few trees 
		are found within the skirting city walls; this makes The Unnamed City one of the most remote 
		and desolate locations in Skunkland with a distinctly eerie feel.  Make sure to check out the 
		massive mines hidden beneath the city and take a subway ride to the western outpost or a 
		handy skeleton grinder.  The Unnamed City can be reached by nether portal with the rail 
		leaving near the South Shore portal or by nether road south of Skaald Fortress (or a very 
		long boat ride south of Alaris or a very long subway ride if you can find access).
