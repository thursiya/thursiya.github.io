					you do it. We offer potting classes at our flower farm in Endermere, and once you're ready to go out on your own we also have

					This newsletter comes to you quite late in thanks to a hard drive failure at our head office. Many apologies - the offending drive 
					has been dealt with. We continue with version 1.8.8, so it looks like we'll just have to wait a little longer for Chorus fruit, 
					Elytra, and bottled Dragon breath.
				</p>
				<p>
					The main project in December for most players was the second Century Build Competition. Thursiya completed work on the Executive 
					Hotel Zefram to house visitors for the competition and also the Fizz Snow Cone Rocket as a snow farm. Outside of Zefram Shylilie 
					has laid the groundwork for a fortress in the nether around the Auverland portal and completed the Prickly Pear cactus farm just 
					east of the Glorious Field. Dropkickz has been popping in to further expand the sky gardens at the border with South Shore. Expect 
					new subway connections by our next newsletter.
				</p>
				<p>
					Continuing with the changes brought in on the last world map, the new map (current to December 2015) is available as a full quality 
					image. There are not many significant changes from the last map, mainly the addition of Cirrus and Zefram.

				<p class="heading">Century Build Competition</p>
				<p>
					Thanks to all of the participants who came out during the year 300 to take part in the many elements of our second Century Build 
					Competition. The snowflake will be left unfinished until March in case anyone who missed their chance would like to add blocks. 
					Probably due to the coincidental timing of the Year 300 between Christmas and New Year's, players ended up extending the official 
					theme of "Building Together" into holiday-related builds. 123weedie gave us a large snowman, packed with chests of snowballs for a 
					snowball fight. Shylilie created a gingerbread house and left chests of "candy" blocks for players to decorate it. Spaceskunks was 
					not able to be physically present at the competition so created submissions to be added on return. Thursiya continued the unofficial 
					Christmas theme with "Zefrehem", converting the animal pen into a nativity scene (out of competition due to thursiya representing 
					the host, Doggy Magical Corporation). The winner of the competition was Shylilie, thanks to an impressive basement in the 
					Collaboration House and the Gingerbread House that perfectly captured the theme of encouraging group participation in building. 
					Participants are awarded prize packages including real estate in the forthcoming town of Mellon Bay, next to Doggy Magical's 
					headquarters.

				<p class="heading">Featured Build: Alaris Farms</p>
				<p>
					At some point in the second century, the people of Skunkland found that mining of metal was not keeping up with demand. Around the 
					same time ocean monuments were added, and Spaceskunks decided it was the right moment to begin construction of various item farms. 
					The Crevasse beacon was temporarily moved to the recently discovered ocean monument off the southwest coast of Alaris (Delve) and 
					work was begun clearing out the monument and preparing it to be a guardian farm. Meanwhile, back on the island province of Alaris, 
					a gold farm (using massive nether portals bringing in wandering zombie pigmen) was started, "The Golden Poppy", and Shylilie joined 
					in to help with construction of an iron farm on the building as well. An iron farm requires iron golems, and they require large 
					numbers of villagers, so the iron farm necessitated construction of a villager farm, this time north of the island across the 
					strait. Today the Golden Poppy draws players from across the globe, who can also stay in the neighbouring "Falling Golem Inn". Make 
					sure you check out the tunnel access to the guardian farm from the sea shack, the hidden opium den under the lake, and Fortenberry 
					Farm to the north. The guardian farm can be reached by nether portal, and The Golden Poppy can be reached by road south from Ennist 
					province, Delve or by nether portal.
