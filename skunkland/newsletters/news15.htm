					We are currently running version 1.8.3, a minor bug fix to 1.8.1 (1.8.2 had a serious error). Players are busy building, 
					touring, and exploring; there's even a rumour that a mycelium island has been discovered!
				</p>
				<p>
					Auverland is now essentially complete and Shylilie has moved on to other projects, including a face lift to Lone Tree Hill. 
					Spaceskunks finished the Golden Poppy iron and gold farm in Alaris with the help of Shylilie so players in need of either now 
					have a good renewable source to visit. Thursiya finished interior construction of the Southside Tower and the neighbouring 
					First Church of the Ravine in New Kingsburg. However, most of the recent work has been happening underground and out of sight. 
					Dropkickz continues to hollow out the Underworks in the Far East and has begun construction projects with Ibn_Battuta. A 
					subway route roughly connects Noricum with Anderson's Crossing, and the awaited long distance connection between Southside New 
					Kingsburg and Johnville is now complete.
				</p>
				<p>
					Construction going on around Skunkland. Clockwise from top left: First Church of the Ravine (New Kingsburg); Ulvenstand (Ulve, 
					Delve); Sapphire Park (Auverland); Southside Tower (New Kingsburg); Far East Underworks; Lone Tree Tower Meeting Hall and the 
					Wishing Tree (Faclair); Western Gateway to Far East Underworks.

				<p><b><i>Special Feature Bonus: Shopping</i></b></p>
				<p>
					Players find many things to occupy their time in Skunkland but many people miss out on serious shopping expeditions. Thanks to 
					the villager <script>wiki("trading")</script> mechanics shopping is a much more involved process than it was back in the old 
					days of donation/trade boxes (which are still alive and well in some towns). Many of our cities feature villagers roaming or 
					confined to appropriate buildings to allow for an easy shopping experience. Remember that villagers will only buy/sell something 
					so many times before they must be refreshed by doing the opposite (i.e. if you sell too much wheat to a farmer it will become 
					unavailable until you buy something). Also some villagers have not had their trade trees maxed out and there is an infinite 
					potential for new villagers in the world. So pack up your emeralds and check out some of the best shopping in Skunkland!
				</p>

				<p><b><i>Featured Build: Ulve</i></b></p>
				<p>
					Returning to circular construction patterns, Spaceskunks finally began a second city in Delve, this time in the central province of 
					Ennist. The city of Ulve is centred on an axis that joins the west road to the nearby University of Ennist and the north road to 
					Delve City. The north half of the city is built to house a small residential and commercial district, including the sizable Howling 
					Wind Inn, that together support the massive Ulvenstand castle in the southern half of the city. Although interior construction is 
					not yet complete the castle will most likely have the largest floor area of any castle in Skunkland and is already one of the largest 
					castles overall. The south road passes through a tunnel beneath Ulvenstand where the Ulvenstand Undermarket can be found, including 
					the city's portal and subway station. Ulve is the geographic and cultural heart of Ennist province and showcases the province's Norse 
					style of grand architecture. See if you can find the nearby standing stones monument, signs of lightning damage on a rooftop, and the 
					mines beneath Ulvenstand. Ulve can be reached by subway south from Delve station, by road south from Delve City, or by nether portal 
					(beyond the Delve portal entrance).
