					<i>The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air.</i>  Which roughly 
					translates to: we are now living in the era of version 1.7.2, the Update that Changed the World. Most of this 
					update's changes are to the world generation so you'll have to go exploring to find them. Fortunately for you, the 
					server has just undergone a major trim and you'll find those flashy new 1.7 biomes much closer than you thought. 
					Things to check out:<br>
					- new <script>wiki("biomes")</script> (e.g. <script>wiki("mesa")</script>, <script>wiki("savanna")</script>, 
					<script>wiki("flower forest")</script>, <script>wiki("ice plains spikes")</script>) and snow at high elevations<br>
					- new <script>wiki("flowers")</script> (including new 2-block tall flowers)<br>
					- new <script>wiki("trees")</script> (acacia and dark oak)<br>
					- <script>wiki("fishing")</script> is now more interesting, including treasure and junk!<br>
					- <script>wiki("stained glass")</script> (finally!)<br>
					- <script>wiki("witches")</script> can now spawn anywhere at night
				</p>

					Summer is over and our builders have been busy emulating their travels on the server in the form of great works (or 
					great absences &#x1F601;) First and foremost we welcome Aninabanina to the server; she has set up shop east of South 
					Shore and started work on her own Commune of Porcinia. Msteveharrison has completed the South Shore Cathedral, moved 
					on, and completed the South Shore Professional Building (colloquially known as "The Twisty Tower"). Thursiya finally 
					started construction on the long-planned city of Celestia, completing the Celestia Corolla (the "roof" of the city) 
					and the southwestern border of Gavel, including the Great Gate of Gavel. The subway network has been mostly on hold 
					although there is now a rough working line between Funland and Celestia.
				</p>

					In this newsletter we offer you the variety of build examples you've come to expect. Left: South Shore Professional 
					Building (South Shore); Top: Top of the Celestia Corolla (Tercomciel province, Gavel); Center: South Shore Cathedral 
					(South Shore); Bottom: Great Gate of Gavel (south Pristina state, Gavel); Right-top: town-in-progress (Porcinia); 
					Right-bottom: Lava Power System (Crevasse volcano). Watch out for an updated world political map in our next newsletter.

				<p><b><i>Featured Build: The Persson International Airport</i></b></p>
				<p>
					The Persson International Airport is a massive project started by thursiya in the summer of 2012. It is located 
					in the southwest corner of the province of Enlil, roughly in the center of Gavel, on the northwest shore of the 
					Sea of Gavel. The airport required months of leveling the local desert terrain (producing the necessary glass 
					for Celestia) and laying out stone for the huge runways. Intended as a reasonable modern metaphor for nether 
					travel, the airport was designed around the idea of having a nether portal in an airplane that could connect to 
					other airplanes in the overworld via dedicated minecart lines in the nether. However, we will have to wait for 
					future airports to be built to see the plan come to fruition. With work done on the terminal, air traffic control 
					tower and the Neth-air jet the airport has officially been completed. Watch for an airport hotel, firestation, 
					and local roadways coming in the future. Make sure to check out the airplane interior and visit the shops in the 
					upstairs of the terminal. Persson Airport can be reached by subway north from Baths Palace or east from Celestia.
