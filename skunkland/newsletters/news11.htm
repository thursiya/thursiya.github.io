				<p>
					Still no word on a release date for 1.8 but new details are being leaked from Mojang on a regular basis. We are currently in version 
					1.7.10, which is really only a few updates to Minecraft Realms.
				</p>
				<p>
					What is this Realms stuff you ask? Running a Minecraft server online essentially requires that it be hosted by a server hosting service 
					(which costs a monthly fee). <a href="https://minecraft.net/realms">Minecraft Realms</a> is a server hosting service created by Mojang. 
					Realms offers relatively inexpensive small servers and standard management tools. We have considered realms for Skunkland but the truth 
					is that Skunkland has outgrown the potential of Realms. Minecraft Realms only supports small servers with up to 20 whitelisted players 
					and 10 players at a time - we already have more than 35 whitelisted players and just as many at a time at a similar cost. I guess we can 
					take comfort in the fact that our current host, Servercraft.co, offers us as good or better than Mojang itself can.
				</p>
				<p>
					And speaking of our current host, this brings up the issue of the <a href="http://aka.ms/MCUsageGuidelines">new End User License Agreement</a> 
					(EULA) for Minecraft and the costs of running our server. Essentially the new EULA outlines that server owners must run their servers 
					similarly to the way we always have, by donation, without any pay-for-perks. Player msteveharrison currently pays for our server hosting 
					services out of his own generous pocket. The costs might not be very high for a small server like ours (less than $20/month) but if you enjoy 
					playing on our server then please consider sending our server owner a few bucks through Paypal to help cover costs - a big thank you to those 
					who have donated money in the past! <span style="font-size: 75%; color: #999"><i></i>(2025-01-29: Dead historical EULA link changed)</i></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					It's finally here! The updated mid-2014 political map for your viewing pleasure. A number of busy players' borders have shifted, a region has 
					been officially designated as an 'abandoned build' (see <a href="../rules#Abandoned Builds">Rules</a> notes on the site), and we have new 
					nations and build sites (plus an expanded subway network). Thank you players for your contributions and, as always, further notes and ideas are 
					always accepted and added regularly. The clickable map links on the site will be updated to the latest map's coordinates over the next few 
					days. If necessary future political map updates will be made more often than once every 6 months.

				<p><b><i>New Feature: Subway Network Tour</i></b></p>
				<p>
					Finding the subway network confusing? Want to get a sense of some of the other areas on the server? Introducing a new player to the server for 
					the first time? Then you may appreciate the new <a href="../tour">Tour feature</a> on the website. The page loads at Spawn with a picture, 
					information, and subway hyper links for touring the entirety of the Skunkland subway network.

				<p><b><i>Century Build Competition</i></b></p>
				<p>
					If you've done careful calculations you will know that Skunk Year 200 begins August 6, 2014 (around 21:00). To celebrate this momentous occasion 
					there will be a building competition at the Century Build Site (subway stop north of Spawn, south of Crevasse) starting on August 6 and ending 
					by midnight of August 11, 2014. The theme of the competition is "Architects of the Future" - the builds are going to be statues that are 
					representative of a player's build (national or otherwise) and the direction it is going in or theme it is embracing. The statues do not have to 
					represent humanoid or even living things, but they must be artistic representations, not buildings or other builds 'of utility'. They may be 
					accompanied by any amount of signage explaining them. The statues must be constructed from a player's own supply of (any) blocks (ship them in 
					or take advantage of the nether chest on site) and must be constructed within one of the &#8539; sections surrounding the station (stake your 
					claim with a sign). Statues may not go below depth 49, exceed height 94 (30m from ground level), or exceed a width of 15m (in either direction). 
					Players may choose to work with other players on a team effort/team representation. If the competition is extremely popular and we run out of 
					sites (currently 8) then new sites will be opened to accommodate need. At the conclusion of the competition prizes (both blocks/items and 
					intangibles) will be awarded by thursiya to all participants and to the best statues (most impressive representation of the theme). So use this 
					month to come up with a plan!

				<p><b><i>Featured Build: Subway Network</i></b></p>
				<p>
					The Skunkland subway network was begun by thursiya shortly after the foundations of New Kingsburg were laid in the first months of the server. 
					The idea for a subway (rather than elevated rail) was hatched to accommodate the various genres and settings of players' builds, by being 
					visually hidden underground. Originally it was planned as a quick way to get between New Kingsburg and Delve and a stop for Desert Town was added 
					along the (very long) route. Because of the need for stops and a desire to expand the possible destinations of the network the original 4-way 
					switching station was developed with the first one being installed along the route at a large picturesque ravine by a swamp that would later 
					develop into Crevasse City, followed soon after by Desert Town and more. The original Delve station was soon scrapped and redirected to a surface 
					access outside of the city and the Crevasse station was redeveloped into a sprawling city station in early 2014, but (as of July 2014) the 
					original, primitive New Kingsburg station where the network started still stands. As yrsyrs got involved in laying routes to the outlying 
					settlements of Crevatia the Thru-Rail corporation was developed to handle Crevatian expansion, in competition with the original Thurail 
					corporation. Since its inception the subway system has seen a number of tweaks to the original 4-way switching station design, the creation of an 
					8-way hub station in Celestia, unique regional routes, and a network that spans from Faclair in the west all the way to Porcinia in the east, and 
					from the far reaches of northern Crevatia to Amahn in the south. As always, future expansions are still planned with thursiya working from the 
					ever-updated Skunkland Transit Plan. Make sure to check out the Crevasse City, Moon Base, and Lut Gholein stations as well as impressive sights on 
					route such as the underground chasms between Delve and Braille, or just ride the rails long enough to gain the achievement!
