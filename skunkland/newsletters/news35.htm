				<blockquote>
					Lunar Hill, Gavel: A small group of what appear to be protesters have gathered outside of the Operis Lunar Hill office. The group is 
					similar to others that have occasionally sprung up across the country, avoiding vigilant big city security forces in favour of smaller 
					communities. The latest concern is the shift to factory farming in Operis operations. Reached for comment, an Operis spokesperson 
					responded, "The market has dictated a need for increased production. We continue to focus on meeting shareholder expectations." This 
					wouldn't be the first commercial controversy here, as unfounded rumours persist of slave labour bolstering the economy.
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Well, thanks to the world being on lockdown, Skunkland has been busier than ever. We continue in version 1.15.2 for the time being, 
					awaiting the next big update that will usher in nether biomes and a number of new blocks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since the end of the Century Build contest, our players have headed back to familiar territory and begun aggressively tackling long 
					overdue projects. We've also seen the return of SpaceNerds, now with a username shift to Keirclarkson. SpaceSkunks has shifted 
					operations south to the mega project in Alaris, preparing for this year's Skyscrapers competition. New builds include the Iron Spire, 
					Star of Alaris complex, and Hansen's Honey Farm, as well as a Steiner's Arms location in Auverland and new custom items for sale at 
					all 3 locations. Shylilie has finally furnished Hastings Apartments, built the Wynyerd Pub in Leawood, and outfitted a new The Block 
					location built by MCG8 (currently PoppyPants1010) in the Far East. Together with thursiya they have added a number of stores to the 
					Auverland Subway Station. Thursiya completed the entrance to Funland, added music to the roller coaster, and built the Marina Centre 
					in Southside, New Kingsburg to finally house The Block. The Crevasse Mall has been undergoing repairs and upgrades, including a new 
					Happy Little Accidents location, fixes to Star Mart, and 2 shops joining the economy, so now players can spend some of that Denarii! 
					Keirclarkson settled in a little hidden valley north of Sedona and has been slowly building a quaint settlement. The economy signs 
					and functions have been completely rewritten to improve legibility, standardization, and ease of price changing. After the Tortilla 
					Flat subway connection was completed, new heli-flight destinations from Persson Airport opened to Mellon Bay, Ghibli Port, and Zefram.
				</p>
				<p>
					Latest builds, left to right, top to bottom: Wynyerd Pub (Leawood, Faclair); Star of Alaris interior chamber (Delve); Auverland Subway 
					Station new businesses; Hastings Manor (Patria); Clarkson settlement (north of Sedona); The Block (east of Deep Pit, Far East); Marina 
					Centre (Southside, New Kingsburg); average home in Ulve (Delve); Honey factory and Iron Spire (Alaris, Delve).

				<p class="heading">World Map</p>
				<p>
					The mapping software has finally been updated to handle the world changes brought in 1.13, and now a 
					<a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LRJQ8R0zdD5zfVhuMH-S5bs9inB9Vp6P/view?usp=sharing">new political map</a> is 
					available to you! The map has expanded westward some to encompass new build areas, and the whole thing had to be redone from scratch 
					in new software due to the unwieldy nature and massive file size of the vector-heavy old format. Main additions are a few shifted 
					borders, new region names and updated settlement names, and the states of Lumina and Sedona.
				</p>
				
				<p class="heading">Century Build</p>
				<p>
					The year is now 614, and the Century Build competition is passed. However, this particular competition has left us with a site with 
					lots to do and enjoy into the future. The winner was Shylilie, who constructed both the Fun Boat Ride (pirate ship) and Hannibal's 
					Haunted Ride, as well as completing a portion of the roller coaster. The main entrance to the park features (appropriately) a 
					scrolling sign. Players can enjoy 4 different rides including river rapids and a full speedway, as well as ride a massive roller 
					coaster with more to come in the future.

				<p class="heading">Featured Build: The Banking System</p>
				<p>
					The first bank in Skunkland was the Bank of Gavel New Kingsburg Regional Branch, founded back in the first century. Back then, the 
					main function of banks was to offer access to the newly-added ender chests and storage for visiting players. Fast-forward to the 
					present, and banking is now the foundation of the massive server economy. While still offering storage services, now players can 
					deposit emeralds to buy one of the server's 3 digital currencies and use that money to buy goods and services around the world. 
					Today there are 3 different bank franchises operating, including the Bank of the North and the Tseles Bank of Commerce (the New 
					Kingsburg branch, the latest bank branch completed, is featured in the image). Banks can be found in every major city in Skunkland, 
					and businesses offering items for sale are usually not too far off.
