					The summer has started and what better way to escape the heatwave than in the wonderful world of Skunkland?  We are currently 
					running version 1.8.7 (no major updates yet).
				</p>
				<p>
					Spaceskunks and Shylilie each came up with their own idea then built each others, the Falling Golem Inn and an opium den, next 
					to the Golden Poppy. They've now moved south of Auverland to try a build from scratch (like starting afresh). Quackey958 has 
					continued with work on an unrevealed project in Badrum. Dropkickz and Ibn_Battuta have dotted the Far East with monuments and 
					mysterious buildings while building a sort of pit city in the Underworks. Their rail lines can now transport a player from the 
					eastern tip of the mainland all the way to the farthest reaches of their building projects (just requiring a jaunt through the 
					wilderness from Porcinia to access). Thursiya has finally built a second airport and constructed a secure nether rail line 
					between Persson International and the New Kingsburg Regional Airport to provide fast long distance travel. The New Kingsburg 
					subway design has been modified to add a station at the new airport so now the Original Line stretches from Ulve all the way 
					east to the Moon Base, through four nations and six significant settlements, and making it one of the most convoluted ways to 
					travel across the map. The planned subway connection between Spawn and Space Town has been completed as well between Pristina 
					Capitol and West Koku, with a small stop in the middle at the contested village for interested shoppers.

					On July 1 the world files were downloaded and a new poltical map drawn up, this time from scratch (partly because it was time to 
					do a total review, but mostly because we switched to a different version of our graphics editing software). The new map is the 
					biggest yet. Beyond featuring uniquely coloured national building zones, subway, settlements, and various points of interest, 
					this map also marks unofficial building zones (in magenta) that are strictly off limits to other players, abandoned builds (in 
					white) that may be taken up (but not looted), and some sections of above-ground rail in the far east and west. With the 
					completion of a working air/nether connection the map also now features the airport network. The detail on the map also seems to 
					warrant a proper PNG file for players to access so maps will now have a download link for the original, full quality image.

					Some of the builds you may have missed in the last few months. Clockwise from top left: Mysterious pit city (Far East); view from 
					the roof of Century Tower (New Kingsburg); Modern buildings in the desert (Far East); Auverland Southern Causeway; New Kingsburg 
					Regional Airport; New Kingsburg Airport Station; New Kingsburg Airport Portal (Nether); The Falling Golem Inn (Alaris province, 
					Delve); Temple Landmark (Far East); Acropolis Nether Portal (East of N. Levantian Ocean).

				<p class="heading">Featured Build: Operis National Distribution Centre</p>
				<p>
					Every player hits the point where their collection of resources gets so large that they need to build a warehouse; in the summer 
					of 2013 thursiya had such a large collection and spread out builds that it was time to build a massive central warehouse. 
					Combining one of Skunkland's first "auto-furnaces", two organized floors of multi-level stacked storage chests, and a basement 
					ranch, auto-farm, and paper mill, the Operis National Distribution Center is the largest central processing building in Skunkland. 
					It was constructed just east of the large building site of Celestia in the north of Masovia to take advantage of swift access to 
					all corners of Gavel. Besides its treasure trove of goods and production facilities, the warehouse also houses a long elevator 
					down to a sizeable strip mine, connected by long passageways to the mines beneath Persson airport. Try to find one of the three 
					secret entrances to the warehouse then make sure to check out the loading bay, auto-farms, and go for a horse ride in the 
					Underdeeps. The Operis National Distribution Centre can be reached by subway east of Celestia, south of Persson Airport, or north 
					of South Shore or the Baths Palace stations.
