		The summer has started and what better way to escape the heatwave than in the wonderful world 
		of Skunkland?  We are currently running version 1.8.7 (no major updates yet).

		Spaceskunks and Shylilie each came up with their own idea then built each others, the Falling 
		Golem Inn and an opium den, next to the Golden Poppy.  They've now moved south of Auverland to 
		try a build from scratch (like starting afresh).  Quackey958 has continued with work on an 
		unrevealed project in Badrum.  Dropkickz and Ibn_Battuta have dotted the Far East with monuments 
		and mysterious buildings while building a sort of pit city in the Underworks.  Their rail lines 
		can now transport a player from the eastern tip of the mainland all the way to the farthest 
		reaches of their building projects (just requiring a jaunt through the wilderness from Porcinia 
		to access).  Thursiya has finally built a second airport and constructed a secure nether rail 
		line between Persson International and the New Kingsburg Regional Airport to provide fast long 
		distance travel.  The New Kingsburg subway design has been modified to add a station at the new 
		airport so now the Original Line stretches from Ulve all the way east to the Moon Base, through 
		four nations and six significant settlements, and making it one of the most convoluted ways to 
		travel across the map.  The planned subway connection between Spawn and Space Town has been 
		completed as well between Pristina Capitol and West Koku, with a small stop in the middle at 
		the contested village for interested shoppers.

		On July 1 the world files were downloaded and a new poltical map drawn up, this time from 
		scratch (partly because it was time to do a total review and mostly because I switched to a 
		different version of Paintshop Pro).  The new map is the biggest yet.  Beyond featuring 
		uniquely coloured national building zones, subway, settlements, and various points of interest, 
		this map also marks unofficial building zones (in magenta) that are strictly off limits to 
		other players, abandoned builds (in white) that may be taken up (but not looted), and some 
		sections of above-ground rail in the far east and west.  With the completion of a working 
		air/nether connection the map also now features the airport network.  The detail on the map 
		also seems to warrant a proper PNG file for players to access so maps will now have a download 
		link for the original, full quality image.

	<p><b><i>Featured Build: Operis National Distribution Center</i></b></p>
	<p>
		Every player hits the point where their collection of resources gets so large that they need to 
		build a warehouse; in the summer of 2013 thursiya had such a large collection and spread out 
		builds that it was time to build a massive central warehouse.  Combining one of Skunkland's 
		first "auto-furnaces", two organized floors of multi-level stacked storage chests, and a 
		basement ranch, auto-farm, and paper mill, the Operis National Distribution Center is the 
		largest central processing building in Skunkland.  It was located just east of the large 
		building site of Celestia in the north of Masovia to take advantage of swift access all corners 
		of Gavel.  Besides its treasure trove of goods and production facilities the warehouse also 
		houses a long elevator down to a sizeable strip mine, connected by long passageways to the 
		mines beneath Persson airport.  Try to find one of the three secret entrances to the warehouse 
		then make sure to check out the loading bay, auto-farms, and go for a horse ride in the 
		Underdeeps.  The Operis National Distribution Center can be reached by subway east of Celestia, 
		south of Persson Airport, or north of South Shore or the Baths Palace stations.
