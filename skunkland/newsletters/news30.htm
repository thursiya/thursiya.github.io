	<p><i>
		New Kingsburg, Gavel - The First City TV News Network has returned to broadcasting. Following a 
		general news lull in Gavel our parent corporation redirected their capital to investments in the 
		great Western Expeditionary Force and our indentured employee contracts were loaned out. With the 
		successful completion of the main phase of the expedition and an increase in national projects we 
		have been able to reopen our news studio. Stay tuned and don't miss a minute with FCTV News.

		Well the World of Color Update has certainly influenced our builders (notice widespread use of 
		concrete in particular) but we're eager for the imminent release of 1.13, the Update Aquatic, and 
		the new creatures and blocks it will bring (not least of which would be new trapdoors!). As 
		virtually all construction in the July-December window happened at the new spawn or beyond the 
		traditional build area (such as Lumina), there was no update to the political map for January; 
		upcoming construction should warrant a new map for July.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since our last update Shylilie, SpaceSkunks, and thursiya ventured through the spawn portal to 
		the first alternate spawn to try out a "new game" experience with no gear and an unexplored 
		location to build in. Shylilie and SpaceSkunks built up the village at the spawn location while 
		thursiya moved south to develop a desert village into the sanctuary town of Huskguard, where new 
		players can safely set up shop and explore from. Then SpaceSkunks returned to working full time 
		on the Lumina project (ongoing mycelium island build) with Shylilie doing some internal 
		decorating. Yrsyrs has built up Fort Resolution with a number of new businesses and even a glass 
		company with a desert rail line for sand harvesting. Although there has been no new subway 
		construction, Shylilie built a rail line through the nether from Auverland to Lumina.

	<p>
		And a return to our wonderful example builds! Top to bottom, left to right: SpaceSkunks' home 
		(new spawn); House living area (Lumina); La Vache Espagnole restaurant (New Kingsburg); Deep Pit 
		redevelopment (Far East); Huskguard walls (new spawn); Sorting warehouse (Lumina); New businesses 
		(Fort Resolution, Crevatia); Huskguard market and Guild of Adventurers (new spawn); Rainbow barn 
		(Deep Pit, Far East); Docks warehouse (Lumina).

	<p><b><i>World Maintenance</i></b></p>
	<p>
		With the coming release of 1.13 (The Update Aquatic) we are planning to regenerate large amounts 
		of the ocean in the map so that the chunks load the new blocks. It seems that the world generation 
		code has not changed the basic shapes at its core so the chunks should be replaced with virtually 
		identical copies of the old ones. Unfortunately the world generation code did change drastically 
		years ago so we will not be able to regenerate oceans that are part of the oldest world generation 
		(mainly the Sea of Gavel and the portions of the Boreal Ocean that border Crevatia and Gavel). So 
		if you have any concerns about work done in ocean chunks please pass them along!
	</p>

	<p><b><i>Featured Build: The Southside Tower</i></b></p>
	<p>
		Following the first Century Build thursiya began construction on a new skyscraper to anchor the 
		New Kingsburg neighbourhood of Southside. The building is roughly based on the old OSCE headquarters 
		in Pristina, Kosovo. The lower part of the tower is filled with many different businesses and its 
		proximity to the Pristina State Courthouse made it a perfect home for two different law offices. As 
		part of the awards package of the first Century Build various players were offered real estate in 
		the tower which resulted in a few condos and a consulate. Although the naming rights to the tower 
		were also awarded they were never exercised and the tower has always gone by its working name. Make 
		sure to check out Shylilie's penthouse, the shopping options at street level, and even a convenient 
		entrance to a popular gentlemen's club. The Southside Tower is located in Southside, New Kingsburg, 
		so it can be easily reached by road, subway (Southside Station), or air.
