				<p class="big heading">*** First City TV News Network ***</p>
				<blockquote>
					New Kingsburg, Gavel - The First City TV News Network has returned to broadcasting. Following a general news lull in Gavel, our parent corporation 
					redirected their capital to investments in the great Western Expeditionary Force, and our indentured employee contracts were loaned out. With the 
					successful completion of the main phase of the expedition and an increase in national projects, we have been able to reopen our news studio. Stay 
					tuned and don't miss a minute with FCTV News.
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Well the World of Color Update has certainly influenced our builders (notice widespread use of concrete in particular), but we're eager for the 
					imminent release of 1.13, the Update Aquatic, and the new creatures and blocks it will bring (not least of which would be new trapdoors!). As 
					virtually all construction in the July-December window happened at the new spawn or beyond the traditional build area (such as Lumina), there was 
					no update to the political map for January; upcoming construction should warrant a new map for July.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since our last update, Shylilie, SpaceSkunks, and thursiya ventured through the spawn portal to the first alternate spawn to try out a "new game" 
					experience with no gear and an unexplored location to build in. Shylilie and SpaceSkunks built up the village at the spawn location while thursiya 
					moved south to develop a desert village into the sanctuary town of Huskguard, where new players can safely set up shop and explore from. Then 
					SpaceSkunks returned to working full time on the Lumina project (ongoing mycelium island build) with Shylilie doing some internal decorating. 
					Yrsyrs has built up Fort Resolution with a number of new businesses and even a glass company with a desert rail line for sand harvesting. Although 
					there has been no new subway construction, Shylilie built a rail line through the nether from Auverland to Lumina.
				</p>
				<p>
					And a return to our wonderful example builds! Top to bottom, left to right: SpaceSkunks' home (new spawn); House living area (Lumina); La Vache 
					Espagnole restaurant (New Kingsburg); Deep Pit redevelopment (Far East); Huskguard walls (new spawn); Sorting warehouse (Lumina); New businesses 
					(Fort Resolution, Crevatia); Huskguard market and Guild of Adventurers (new spawn); Rainbow barn (Deep Pit, Far East); Docks warehouse (Lumina).

				<p class="heading">World Maintenance</p>
				<p>
					With the coming release of 1.13 (The Update Aquatic) we are planning to regenerate large amounts of the ocean in the map so that the chunks load 
					the new blocks. It seems that the world generation code has not changed the basic shapes at its core, so the chunks should be replaced with 
					virtually identical copies of the old ones. Unfortunately, the world generation code did change drastically years ago, so we will not be able to 
					regenerate oceans that are part of the oldest world generation (mainly the Sea of Gavel and the portions of the Boreal Ocean that border Crevatia 
					and Gavel). If you have any concerns about work done in ocean chunks please pass them along!
				</p>
				
				<p class="heading">Featured Build: The Southside Tower</p>
				<p>
					Following the first Century Build, thursiya began construction on a new skyscraper to anchor the New Kingsburg neighbourhood of Southside. The 
					building is roughly based on the old OSCE headquarters in Pristina, Kosovo. The lower part of the tower is filled with many different businesses, 
					and its proximity to the Pristina State Courthouse made it a perfect home for two different law offices. As part of the awards package of the first 
					Century Build, various players were offered real estate in the tower, which resulted in a few condos and a consulate. Although the naming rights to 
					the tower were also awarded, they were never exercised, and the tower has always gone by its working name. Make sure to check out Shylilie's 
					penthouse, the shopping options at street level, and even a convenient entrance to a popular gentlemen's club. The Southside Tower is located in 
					Southside, New Kingsburg, so it can be easily reached by road, subway (Southside Station), or air.
