					A new age of machines is upon us! We are currently on version 1.5, the Redstone Update. As can be expected from its 
					name, this update offers a large number of improvements related to redstone computing, so for those redstone buffs 
					out there this is the update for you. Important new things to be aware of:<br>
					- <script>wiki("redstone blocks")</script> (redstone source block)<br>
					- <script>wiki("comparator")</script> (redstone signal subraction, signal from storage containers)<br>
					- <script>wiki("trapped chest")</script> (regular chest that gives off redstone signal when opened)<br>
					- <script>wiki("hopper")</script> (transfer items between storage containers like pipes), <script>wiki("minecart with hopper")</script>, 
					and the <script>wiki("dropper")</script> (variant of dispenser which can move items upward)<br>
					- light and <script>wiki("heavy weighted pressure plates")</script> (for making item "scales")<br>
					- <script>wiki("daylight sensor")</script><br>
					- smelt netherrack into <script>wiki("nether brick")</script><br>
					- <script>wiki("nether quartz")</script> (which can be crafted into a <script>wiki("block of quartz")</script>, slabs, 
					stairs, chiseled, and pillar varieties)<br>
					- water physics slightly changed (no more random whirlpools in ocean depths!) and bone meal is less effective now<br>
					- mobs will now avoid walking over rails, zombies are tougher, and skeletons shoot farther<br>
					- new abandoned mineshafts will have chests in minecarts instead of just on the ground<br>
					- some improvements to the lighting engine (although a full rewrite is still in the works)<br>
					- inventory management improvements (drag stacks over slots with right mouse for singles or left mouse for equal spread)
				</p>
				<p>
					For a complete list of changes in this and previous updates see <script>wiki("Java Edition version history")</script>. 
					1.5.1 is expected soon and should address some known bugs like newly placed paintings now only appearing after you relog.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since Christmas most builders have been pretty busy off server so we haven't seen a whole lot of construction. Some 
					things you might notice include new franchises in South Shore (now skirted by a retaining wall), the completion of the 
					Persson International Airport terminal building (bringing the ambitious project much closer to completion), and the 
					roof of Delve is now missing as reconstruction of Delve HQ is underway. The subway network has now extended north from 
					the Baths Palace to Persson International Airport (Enlil province) and Thrurail corporation intends to extend the subway 
					north from Anderson's Crossing to Gickerville soon.
				</p>
				<p>
					For this newsletter update we've included a few current build examples. Clockwise from top-left: msteveharrison's roller 
					coaster outside South Shore (last chance to see as he is in the process of dismantling it); main floor of the recently 
					completed Persson Airport terminal (west Enlil province, Gavel); yrsyrs' western cottage (probably last chance to see as 
					it is built beyond the proposed trim boundary); prison cells below Koku's courthouse (Koku Kingdom). If there is something 
					you would like to see featured in a future newsletter please contact thursiya with your suggestion.

				<p><b><i>Important Server World Notice</i></b></p>
				<p>
					With the release of the Redstone Update it has been decided to trim the server world again. This trim would involve cutting 
					the overworld down to approximately what is pictured in the last newsletter's political map and removing the nether 
					completely. This will allow new players to gain immediate access to 1.5 terrain by heading south of spawn and will populate 
					the nether with nether quartz. The trim is scheduled for Monday, March 18 so that players have time to recover materials 
					from the nether and outer overworld, and maybe do a last run through before it is refreshed.
				</p>

				<p><b><i>Featured Build: The Baths Palace</i></b></p>
				<p>
					This time the featured build is the Baths Palace by thursiya. The palace was one of the first significant builds to be 
					completed with the structure, surrounding lake, and canal completed in May 2012. Built by request of thursiya's wife, the 
					Baths Palace is a loose recreation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81azienki_Palace">&#321;azienki Palace</a> in 
					Warsaw. Having minimal knowledge of the interior of the palace, thursiya recreated a central rotunda and located the eponymous 
					baths in the rear, then built appropriate palatial rooms throughout the remainder. Besides the baths, inside you will find 
					multiple guest rooms, servants' quarters, ballroom, chapel, and a library. The lake around the palace was connected to Moon 
					River and a long canal tunnel was built to connect the back side of the palace to the river dividing South Shore and Masovia 
					state. Make sure to check out the baths, state rooms, and maybe even venture into the hidden tunnels beneath the palace. The 
					Baths Palace can be reached by subway north from Lunar Hill, west from South Shore, or south from Persson Airport. The road 
					connection is still under construction (nearby access is from South Shore or Lunar Hill) and will come as more buildings 
					populate Masovia state and the area around the subway station.
