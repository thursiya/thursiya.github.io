		A new age of machines is upon us!  We are currently on version 1.5, the Redstone Update.  As 
		can be expected from its name, this update offers a large number of improvements related to 
		redstone computing, so for those redstone buffs out there this is the update for you. 
		Important new things to be aware of:<br>
		- <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Block_of_Redstone">redstone blocks</a> 
		(redstone source block)<br>
		- <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Redstone_Comparator">comparator</a> (redstone 
		signal subraction, signal from storage containers)<br>
		- <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Trapped_Chest">trapped chest</a> (regular chest 
		that gives off redstone signal when opened)<br>
		- <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Hopper">hopper</a> (transfer items between storage 
		containers like pipes), <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Minecart_with_Hopper">hopper 
		minecarts</a>, and the <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Dropper">dropper</a> (variant 
		of dispenser which can move items upward)<br>
		- <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Weighted_Pressure_Plate">weighted pressure 
		plates</a> (for making item "scales")<br>
		- <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Daylight_Sensor">daylight sensor</a><br>

		<a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Nether_Brick_(item)">netherbrick</a><br>
		- <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Nether_Quartz">nether quartz</a> (which can be 
		crafted into <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Block_of_Quartz">blocks</a>, slabs, 
		stairs, chiseled, and pillar varieties)<br>
		- water physics slightly changed (no more random whirlpools in ocean depths!) and bone meal is 
		less effective now<br>
		- mobs will now avoid walking over rails, zombies are tougher, and skeletons shoot farther<br>
		- new abandoned mineshafts will have chests in minecarts instead of just on the ground<br>
		- some improvements to the <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Light#1.5">lighting</a> 
		engine (although a full rewrite is still in the works)<br>
		- inventory management improvements (drag stacks over slots with right mouse for singles or 
		left mouse for equal spread)
	</p>
	<p>
		For a complete list of changes in this and previous updates see 
		<a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history">Version History</a>.  1.5.1 is 
		expected soon and should address some known bugs like newly placed paintings now only appearing 
		after you relog.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since Christmas most builders have been pretty busy off server so we haven't seen a whole lot 
		of construction.  Some things you might notice include new franchises in South Shore (now 
		skirted by a retaining wall), the completion of the Persson International Airport terminal 
		building (bringing the ambitious project much closer to completion), and the roof of Delve is 
		now missing as reconstruction of Delve HQ is underway.  The subway network has now extended 
		north from the Baths Palace to Persson International Airport (Enlil province) and Thrurail 
		corporation intends to extend the subway north from Anderson's Crossing to Gickerville soon.
	</p>
	<p>
		For this newsletter update we've included a few current build examples.  Clockwise from 
		top-left: msteveharrison's roller coaster outside South Shore (last chance to see as he is in 
		the process of dismantling it); main floor of the recently completed Persson Airport terminal 
		(west Enlil province, Gavel); yrsyrs' western cottage (probably last chance to see as it is 
		built beyond the proposed trim boundary); prison cells below Koku's courthouse (Koku Kingdom). 
		If there is something you would like to see featured in a future newsletter please contact 
		thursiya with your suggestion.

	<p><b><i>Important Server World Notice</i></b></p>
	<p>
		With the release of the Redstone Update it has been decided to trim the server world again. 
		This trim would involve cutting the overworld down to approximately what is pictured in the 
		last newsletter's political map and removing the nether completely.  This will allow new 
		players to gain immediate access to 1.5 terrain by heading south of spawn and will populate 
		the nether with nether quartz.  The trim is scheduled for Monday, March 18 so that players 
		have time to recover materials from the nether and outer overworld, and maybe do a last run 
		through before it is refreshed.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p><b><i>Featured Build: The Baths Palace</i></b></p>
	<p>
		This time the featured build is the Baths Palace by thursiya.  The palace was one of the first 
		significant builds to be completed with the structure, surrounding lake, and canal completed in 
		May 2012.  Built by request of thursiya's wife, the Baths Palace is a loose recreation of 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81azienki_Palace">&#321;azienki Palace</a> in Warsaw. 
		Having minimal knowledge of the interior of the palace, thursiya recreated a central rotunda 
		and located the eponymous baths in the rear, then built appropriate palatial rooms throughout 
		the remainder.  Besides the baths, inside you will find multiple guest rooms, servants' 
		quarters, ballroom, chapel, and a library.  The lake around the palace was connected to Moon 
		River and a long canal tunnel was built to connect the back side of the palace to the river 
		dividing South Shore and Masovia state.  Make sure to check out the baths, state rooms, and 
		maybe even venture into the hidden tunnels beneath the palace.  The Baths Palace can be reached 
		by subway north from Lunar Hill, west from South Shore, or south from Persson Airport.  The 
		road connection is still under construction (nearby access is from South Shore or Lunar Hill) 
		and will come as more buildings populate Masovia state and the area around the subway station.
