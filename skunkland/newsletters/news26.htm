					It's been a long few (sick - for many of us) months and a lot has happened. Our 5 year (real world) anniversary has come and gone; thank you to 
					all of those players past and present who have made Skunkland the very special place that it is. We'd like to see the server continue for as 
					long as possible, but financial constraints mean that might not be possible, so please consider donating some money to SpaceSkunks to keep the 
					server running and open to new players. For less than a dollar a day you can give the gift of collective escapism to deserving nerdy adults &#x1f601;.

					We are currently running version 1.11.2, which means the Exploration Update has finally come! Some important things to look out for since version 1.11:<br>
					- <script>wiki("Woodland Mansions")</script>, a new generated structure with unique mobs and drops (including some cursed items and the <script>wiki("Totem of Undying")</script>)<br>
					- <script>wiki("Exploration Maps")</script> (for finding Ocean Monuments and Woodland Mansions), sold by new "Cartographer" villager profession<br>
					- <script>wiki("Llamas")</script>!<br>
					- <script>wiki("Shulker Box")</script> (the ultimate storage solution)<br>
					1.11.1 also added firework rocket boosting for elytra flight and the ability to smelt old iron and gold tools and armour into nuggets (finally, a 
					use for all of those zombie pigman gold swords!). 1.11.2 seems to have only added an annoying bug with dismounting from a minecart that is not on 
					a rail, which our players will notice as elevators being broken, although this should be patched with a future release.

					After quickly claiming a Mellon Bay construction site for a branch of Mesa Importers, Shylilie has been very busy mostly with expanding Faclair in 
					the south, in a new region called Sartori, with a town filled with homes and various construction services. Important additions have been made in 
					the Patria region, mainly the completed construction of Faclair Hospital and JAPP police services. Dropkickz (with a little help from MCG8) has 
					greatly expanded and refined the area around Deep Pit. To celebrate the server's fifth anniversary, thursiya headed back to New Kingsburg and 
					built the First City TV Tower. Thursiya also completed most of the internals of the Doggy Magical HQ in Mellon Bay and is working on expanding 
					roads and the highway system throughout Gavel. SpaceSkunks has finished external construction of Hastings Manor, the air ship, the Hall of 
					Resource in Delve's Azuriel Palace, and even stopped by Mellon Bay to add Madeline Mim's Potions and Preparations - all before demolishing the 
					central district of Delve to build the city deeper. Working with Shylilie they have built the massive Guardian Bridge linking Shylilie's recent 
					region of Sartori in the west with SpaceSkunks' Alaris province to the east. The subway has expanded south from Auverland Market to Sartori and 
					east over the Guardian Bridge to Alaris, plus an official station now exists in the Far East at Deep Pit.

					Bridge (Between Sartori, Faclair and Alaris province, Delve); Faclair Hospital (Patria); Hall of Resource (Azuriel Palace, Delve City); Deep Pit 
					environs (Far East); JAPP security (Patria, Faclair); First City TV Tower (New Kingsburg); Madeline Mim's (Mellon Bay, Masovia state, Gavel); 
					completed Airship (Delve City).

				<p class="heading">Possible Server Changes</p>
				<blockquote>
					Spawn Station - Delve Co. arcane researchers have made a breakthrough today and have discovered a new land through an enchanted wormhole. Using 
					an enchanted sign as a focal point for the worm hole, Delve Co. researchers have traveled to this new land to find new wonders and, hopefully, 
					riches. Unfortunately the technology has proven unreliable, disrupting travel in Skunkland, and Delve Co. have suspended trans-dimensional travel 
					until more experiments have been done.
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Over the last couple months, the powers that be in Skunkland have reviewed the server direction and discussed possible changes. The first was the 
					possibility of running Multi-verse, a Bukkit plugin that allows multiple Minecraft worlds to run simultaneously on the same server with the 
					possibility to travel between them. Unfortunately, we found that running a Bukkit server added a few unexpected glitches, so this remains on the 
					back burner for the time being. The second change, implemented immediately, is to add an age restriction for future new players. We've had some 
					issues with very young players, often adding a lot of work for our management team, and we think it best to restrict new players to ages 13 and 
					up. Although families play in Skunkland, this is not an officially "family-friendly" server, and young players and their guardians are made aware 
					of potential adult conversations and content coming up.

				<p class="heading">Featured Build: Red Rose Mall</p>
				<p>
					After winning the second Century Build competition, Shylilie contacted thursiya about claiming the grand prize, assistance with creating a mall. 
					The mall would be built in the newly developing community south of Cadwgan, called Patria, and Shylilie decided it would be a cooperative build 
					with thursiya and SpaceSkunks. Thursiya drew up designs to match Shylilie's needs and the layout of the lot on the Trunk river bank, then 
					Shylilie and SpaceSkunks got to building and decorating the mall. Work on the Doggy Magical department store was completed in May 2016, with the 
					last few store fronts being filled shortly after. Development of the mall coincided with the introduction of the new economy system, so the Red 
					Rose Mall boasts the very first stores selling tangible items, including a food court, brewing supplies, and a pop-up shop currently selling 
					enchanted bows. The mall is also located beside a beautiful public park, the local Block store outlet, and a grocery store. Make sure to check 
					out the various offerings in the food court, find something special in Doggy Magical, or even find a surprise or two in Magic Touch. Red Rose 
					Mall can be reached by road south of Cadwgan, by plane (just north of the Faclair airport), or by subway (use the north exit of West Patria station).
