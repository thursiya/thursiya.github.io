		It's been a long few (sick - for many of us) months and a lot has happened.  Our 5 year (real 
		world) anniversary has come and gone; thank you to all of those players past and present who 
		have made Skunkland the very special place that it is.  We'd like to see the server continue 
		for as long as possible but financial constraints mean that might not be possible so please 
		consider donating some money to SpaceSkunks to keep the server running and open to new 
		players.  For less than a dollar a day you can give the gift of collective escapism to 
		deserving nerdy adults :)

		We are currently running version 1.11.2 which means the Exploration Update has finally come!  
		Some important things to look out for since version 1.11:<br>
		- <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Woodland_mansion">Woodland Mansions</a>, a new 
		generated structure with unique mobs and drops (including some cursed items and the 
		<a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Totem_of_Undying">Totem of Undying</a>)<br>
		- <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Exploration_Map">Exploration Maps</a> (for finding 
		Ocean Monuments and Woodland Mansions), sold by new "Cartographer" villager profession<br>
		- <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Llama">Llamas</a>!<br>
		- <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Shulker_Box">Shulker Box</a> (the ultimate storage 
		solution)<br>
		1.11.1 also added firework rocket boosting for elytra flight and the ability to smelt old 
		iron and gold tools and armour into nuggets (finally, a use for all of those zombie pigman 
		gold swords!).  1.11.2 seems to have only added an annoying bug with dismounting from a 
		minecart that is not on a rail which our players will notice as elevators being broken, 
		although this should be patched with a future release.

		After quickly claiming a Mellon Bay construction site for a branch of Mesa Importers 
		Shylilie has been very busy mostly with expanding Faclair in the south in a new region 
		called Sartori with a town filled with homes and various construction services.  Important 
		additions have been made in the Patria region, mainly the completed construction of Faclair 
		Hospital and JAPP police services.  Dropkickz (with a little help from MCG8) has greatly 
		expanded and refined the area around Deep Pit.  To celebrate the server's fifth anniversary 
		thursiya headed back to New Kingsburg and built the First City TV Tower.  Thursiya also 
		completed most of the internals of the Doggy Magical HQ in Mellon Bay and is working on 
		expanding roads and the highway system throughout Gavel.  SpaceSkunks has finished external 
		construction of Hastings Manor, the air ship, the Hall of Resource in Delve's Azuriel Palace 
		and even stopped by Mellon Bay to add Madeline Mim's Potions and Preparations - all before 
		demolishing the central district of Delve to build the city deeper.  Working with Shylilie 
		they have built the massive Guardian Bridge linking Shylilie's recent region of Sartori in 
		the west with SpaceSkunks' Alaris province to the east.  The subway has expanded south from 
		Auverland Market to Sartori and east over the Guardian Bridge to Alaris, plus an official 
		station now exists in the Far East at Deep Pit.

	<p><b><i>Possible Server Changes</i></b></p>
	<p><i>
		Spawn Station - Delve Co. arcane researchers have made a breakthrough today and have 
		discovered a new land through an enchanted wormhole. Using an enchanted sign as a focal 
		point for the worm hole Delve Co. researchers have traveled to this new land to find new 
		wonders and, hopefully, riches.  Unfortunately the technology has proven unreliable, 
		disrupting travel in Skunkland, and Delve Co. have suspended trans-dimensional travel until 
		more experiments have been done.
	</i></p>
	<p>
		Over the last couple months the powers that be in Skunkland have reviewed the server 
		direction and discussed possible changes.  The first was the possibility of running 
		Multi-verse, a Bukkit plugin that allows multiple Minecraft worlds to run simultaneously on 
		the same server with the possibility to travel between them.  Unfortunately we found that 
		running a Bukkit server added a few unexpected glitches so this remains on the back burner 
		for the time being.  The second change, implemented immediately, is to add an age 
		restriction for future new players.  We've had some issues with very young players, often 
		adding a lot of work for our management team, and we think it best to restrict new players 
		to ages 13 and up.  Although families play in Skunkland this is not an officially 
		"family-friendly" server and young players and their guardians are made aware of potential 
		adult conversations and content coming up.

	<p><b><i>Featured Build: Red Rose Mall</i></b></p>
	<p>
		After winning the second Century Build competition, Shylilie contacted thursiya about 
		claiming the grand prize, assistance with creating a mall.  The mall would be built in the 
		newly developing community south of Cadwgan called Patria and Shylilie decided it would be 
		a cooperative build with thursiya and SpaceSkunks.  Thursiya drew up designs to match 
		Shylilie's needs and the layout of the lot on the Trunk river bank then Shylilie and 
		SpaceSkunks got to building and decorating the mall.  Work on the Doggy Magical department 
		store was completed in May 2016 with the last few store fronts being filled shortly after.  
		Development of the mall coincided with the introduction of the new economy system so the Red 
		Rose Mall boasts the very first stores selling tangible items, including a food court, 
		brewing supplies, and a pop-up shop currently selling enchanted bows.  The mall is also 
		located beside a beautiful public park, the local Block store outlet, and a grocery store.  
		Make sure to check out the various offerings in the food court, find something special in 
		Doggy Magical, or even find a surprise or two in Magic Touch.  Red Rose Mall can be reached 
		by road south of Cadwgan, by plane (just north of the Faclair airport), or by subway (use 
		the north exit of West Patria station).
