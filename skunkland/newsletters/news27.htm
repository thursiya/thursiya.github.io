					Announcement: Are you getting ready to party like it's 399? (Don't worry, you still have about a decade left to plan your party.) To 
					celebrate the dawn of the year 400, the Government of Gavel and the Tsai Group are sponsoring the third Century Build Competition. 
					The theme will be Home away from Home. More to come!
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					If you've been away from the server for a bit, then now is a good time to get back in the hang of things - version 1.12 is coming 
					soon with some new blocks, and our third Century Build competition will be in late May. We look forward to seeing you in our "home away 
					from home". Note to players: with no new update yet, the minecart dismount/elevator bug is still an issue, so be careful when using them.

					After receiving a number of complaints from SpaceSkunks about lack of roads and access in Gavel, thursiya decided to do something about 
					it, starting with roads and bridges linking Zefram to Celestia and Mellon Bay, and topping it off with the first links of the elevated 
					Gavel Highway running from Northside New Kingsburg through Celestia and north to the future site of the Gavel capital. Shylilie found 
					that the old warehouse in Auverland just wasn't cutting it anymore and decided to tear it down and build a new, much larger warehouse 
					complex in a secret location, leaving the old site open for development in Auverland again. Dropkickz and MCG8 have been working in and 
					around Deep Pit adding more layers and interesting new buildings. We hope to see yrsyrs back more regularly in a bit (after some 
					much-needed elytra practice!). SpaceSkunks slowed down after a very busy pre-Christmas building period and took some time out to help 
					Shylilie with redstone contraptions.

					Here's a view of recent builds and hints of what's to come. Clockwise from top left: Gavel Highway segment (northeast from Celestia); 
					Gutted downtown core of Delve City; Looking up Deep Pit; Archoneau Bridge (Tercomciel-Masovia border, Gavel); Fengyu Bridge 
					(Zephyr-Tercomciel border, Gavel); Shylilie's warehouse, top level; New construction ideas (beside Deep Pit); X-ray view of Lone Tree 
					Mine (between Auverland and Cadwgan).

				<p class="heading">World Maintenance</p>
				<p>
					Ever wondered what your friendly server admin is doing in the wee hours of the morning or why sometimes when you're building the 
					darkening world suddenly turns to day? Our server has a strict survival policy, meaning that we pride ourselves in building everything 
					from scratch, collecting the materials and risking certain death as we piece together our world. However, when it comes to server 
					business, thursiya switches hats and breaks into creative mode to deal with whatever it may be. Server business includes checking in 
					with players to make sure everything is working out or to see what they're building for a future newsletter (which often includes 
					teleporting or flying about). It also includes installing economy signs (which require command blocks to place) and making sure the 
					economy system is working correctly. One of the less visible admin activities is world maintenance, which includes repairing 
					environmental damage from endermen and errant creepers, removing floating bits of the environment (such as tree tops without trees 
					underneath or floating islands/blocks created by the world generation code), and smoothing out the terrain. Our world is very old and 
					has been through a few trims which can leave some rough borders between sections of the map (for instance, the massive wall of stone 
					that's been left south of Spawn), so admin attempts to clean up these breaks and make them flow a little more naturally.

				<p class="heading">Featured Build: World Tree</p>
				<p>
					Although the Jungle Tours project was started a long time ago, it wasn't until quite recently that Shylilie put the finishing touches 
					on its crowning jewel, the massive World Tree that the tour route circles. Like many of the largest builds in Skunkland, this one 
					dogged its creator for a long time and remained partially complete. And just like the surrounding jungle, this tree required a massive 
					amount of imported jungle material (above and beyond what was grown on site). At 91m from entrances to tree tops, it is the tallest 
					"structure" in Faclair. The four main entrances lead into a central domed chamber that looks up into the colossal canopy space, and 
					further staircases lead down into a basement and storage area. Make sure to check out the nearby Jungle Tours site, including a 
					private hot spring and guide shop, and see if you can find the access route to the area above the dome inside the World Tree. The World 
					Tree can be reached by road east of Cirrus or west of Cadwgan, or by nether portal (located right in the tree).
