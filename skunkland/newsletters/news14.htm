		Happy New Year from the heart of Skunkland!  That's the year 236 around these parts.  We are 
		still happily running version 1.8.1 with few hiccups.  Our website continues to be regularly 
		updated with new information and pictures from Skunkland.

		Most of the developments in the last couple of months have been happening in the south for a 
		change.  Not content with clearing an ocean monument and building a small guardian farm, 
		Spaceskunks has been working on gold farms (harvesting zombie pigmen) in both the nether and 
		Alaris province (Delve) - this after completing exterior construction of the fabulous castle 
		Ulvenstand in Ulve (Ennist, Delve).  Shylilie has been building out the last major spaces in 
		Auverland including a hedge maze, park, and warehouse and has begun a large-scale project near 
		the Jungle Tours in Faclair.  Taking a break from hollowing out the streets of Celestia and 
		the Gavel Underdeeps, Thursiya has completed exterior construction of the promised (and 
		yet-to-be-named) tower in New Kingsburg and is awaiting the last Century Build participants' 
		choice of real estate.  All three aforementioned players teamed up to build subways to the 
		Grand Mesa and found a mesa mining town, Red Rock.  Meanwhile Quackey958 has begun construction 
		of an above-ground light rail to connect Badrum's Imperial City with Alf-Wy.  Subway routes 
		have now been cut south from Delve and east from Cadwgan to Ulve, with a further route heading 
		southeast to Red Rock.  Subway routes now also close the loop between Spawn - Red Rock - Dragon 
		Ridge - Sofia - Johnville, allowing faster access to the south east.

		The latest Skunkland political map is here.  At first glance it may not look particularly 
		different from the last but pay close attention to the large expansions in Faclair and Delve, 
		plus a significant southern expansion of the subway system.  Also more of the trimlines from 
		the last big trim have been cleaned up.  Want to carve out your own piece of the map?  Contact 
		thursiya about designating your space as a national build or if you have any local names and 
		tidbits to share for future maps.

		Also included in this newsletter is a franchise map of Skunkland representing all of the (less 
		than unique) businesses with at least two locations.  Franchises are one of the ways that 
		players spread their build vision and participate in each other's builds.

	<p><b><i>Featured Build: C&C's Bed and Breakfast</i></b></p>
	<p>
		A minor wonder in its own right, yrsyrs' franchises of C&C's Bed and Breakfast are spread 
		across central Skunkland.  The good name of C&C goes all the way back to before the foundations 
		of the first nations when yrsyrs decided to build and brand quaint shelters in the various 
		villages and along major routes.  The C&C Bed and Breakfast locations are easily spotted by 
		their red and yellow roof trim.  They always have a safe bed to sleep in and at least one form 
		of food for the hungry traveler.  There are now more than a dozen locations including seven 
		sprinkled around Crevatia, Desert Town, Johnville, Sofia, and one in southern Pristina (Gavel).  
		Make sure to note locations on the included Skunkland Franchise Map before planning your next 
		trip over land.  C&C Bed and Breakfasts can be located along many major roads in central 
		Skunkland.
