				<p>
					No major changes on Mojang's end since our last newsletter means we are still in version 1.7.2 and rather than 
					trimming to make room for new terrain admin has been busy cleaning up the trimmed terrain around our server (so 
					there are less hideous breaks between old and new terrain). We've also had a number of new builders join us and 
					things have been busier than ever; Christmas Eve we hit a new record: 6 players on simultaneously!
				</p>
				<p>
					We welcome two new regular builders to our ranks: easy_spirit (who has claimed the land east of South Shore) and 
					nebby28 (who has moved so far south as to not fit on the conventional map). The biggest build news this season 
					would be Msteveharrison & Aninabanina's Moon Base, south of South Shore. Thursiya has consolidated various 
					warehouses into the massive Operis National Distribution Centre. The builders of Mysteria have returned to add a 
					number of new additions. All of this construction has demanded an increase in the subway network. South Shore now 
					has three new connections: east to Porcinia, south to the Moon Base (also now connected to Lunar Hill), and north 
					to the new stop, Mellon Bay. Celestia has added Mellon Bay and Baths Palace connections and the long-awaited 
					connections of Desert Town-William's Harbour and Delve-Mysteria are complete.
				</p>
				<p>
					We've included an updated world political map and a selection of some of the latest builds. Clockwise from top 
					left: Christmas Gifts from yrsyrs (Hometree, Crevasse); Community Christmas Tree (Mysteria); easy_spirit's tree 
					platforms (east of South Shore); Moon Base Dome Interior (south of South Shore); Operis National Distribution 
					Centre (Masovia state, Gavel); nebby28's village (far south of Spawn); Center: Moon Base bird's eye view.

				<p class="heading">Holiday Celebrations</p>
				<p>
					For those players who haven't picked them up already, yrsyrs has left Christmas gifts for all our regulars at 
					Hometree (get off at Crevasse subway station). Also, yrsyrs will again entertain us with a special New Year's Eve 
					fireworks show at 10pm (tomorrow). This year's fireworks venue is the village under Fort Resolution and you can be 
					sure to have an excellent view from the fort itself (get off at Anderson's Crossing subway station then trek 
					northwest along the roads).
				</p>
				
				<p class="heading">Featured Build: Mysteria</p>
				<p>
					Mysteria, founded last year by Spacenerds, Wezzie18, and 123weedie, is the first large-scale cooperative build 
					started on the server. Although initially barely more than a village of slipshod structures it has matured into a 
					fine town of creative new projects. Mysteria was one of the first settlements founded "beyond the trim line". 
					Recently it experienced a revitalization thanks to a new subway line, the demolition of abandoned structures, and 
					the dedication of its founders to completing many small builds. A marketplace is currently under construction and 
					buildings have started spilling out beyond the conventional town boundaries potentially leading to a new city on 
					the server. Make sure to check out the shops, homes built right into the hills, the lovely cottages outside of town, 
					and the epic caverns on the subway route just before you arrive. Mysteria can be reached by subway west of Delve.
