				<blockquote>
					Advertisement: Come visit Skunkland's original bustling town, Eweton! Home of the oldest coffee house in Skunkland, the first large church, 
					Crevatian government buildings, and the venerated Eweton Fight Club - there's something for everyone. This farm town has grown into the 
					city for discerning shoppers. So come tour the automated farms, grab a bite at Smooth Ricky's, and get to know Crevatia's other city: 
					Eweton - it's more than just sheep!
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					Colour! Fabulous Colour! Well, we've always had colour, but we're finally running version 1.12, "<script>wiki("The World of Color Update")</script>", 
					so now our colours are much more vibrant and come in concrete and psychedelic glazed terracotta blocks. Plus all those colourful beds &#x1f600;. 
					Here are some things to look out for in 1.12:<br>
					- <script>wiki("Concrete Blocks")</script> (and <script>wiki("concrete powder")</script> for turning into blocks)<br>
					- <script>wiki("Glazed Terracotta")</script> (colourful, decorated blocks made from smelting hardened clay, now called terracotta)<br>
					- <script>wiki("Parrots")</script>! (you can even get them to sit on your shoulder!)<br>
					- new <script>wiki("Note block")</script> instrument options<br>
					- a <script>wiki("Recipe Book")</script> is now built in to crafting (saving some wiki visits!)<br>
					- Beds now come in all 16 colours (depending on wool used) and can be dyed<br>
					- <script>wiki("Functions")</script> accessible from commands mean more possibilities for the server economy (no longer limited to just 4 commands per sign)
				</p>
				<p>
					Various building projects have been underway besides the Century Build Competition, but we'll save reporting on those until our next newsletter.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also included in this newsletter is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0KxjcJqLLD4THJiaVBHTzg2Nnc/view?usp=sharing">link to the latest political map</a> (July 2017).

				<p class="heading">Mystery Locations</p>
				<p>
					It seems a few of our players were able to identify most of the locations in our first Mystery 	Location picture, but nobody was able to identify 
					all 7. Next time will be a little tougher! So here are the answers, clockwise from top left:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>C&C's Bed & Breakfast and Petro-Craft located west of Eweton and northeast of William's Harbour in Crevatia (on the south side of Midgewater Swamp).
					<li>The covered elevated rail line leaving The Imperial City, Badrum for Alf-Wy.
					<li>Lone Tree Tower Lookout and Meetings (above Lone Tree Mine, just north of Auverland en route to Cadwgan, Faclair).
					<li>View from the giant tree beside Deep Pit, looking out over MCG8's builds.
					<li>Town Blacksmith in Ulve, Ennist province, Delve.
					<li>Eastern flat kitchen/living room in Northside Flats, New Kingsburg, Gavel (look closely to see Southside Tower through the window).
					<li>The Expo 400 Site (where the Year 400 Century Build would take place) in the midst of Enlil province, Gavel (east of Persson Airport and northwest of Ottokar Fortress).
				</ol>
				
				<p class="heading">Century Build Competition</p>
				<p>
					A big thank you to all who participated in our third Century Build competition; this time we had the most entries yet! The official competition 
					wrapped on May 23, but players are of course welcome to come back and add finishing touches to their builds or add further memories or art pieces 
					in the Expo 400 Gallery, which will be completed in the near future. So if you have a particularly large art piece you wanted to fit in, it's 
					best you do that before the architectural frame is built. Players embraced the 'home' theme, and all six of our participants built a copy of a 
					home they had previously lived in (almost all childhood houses). We also got a handful of fun community memories and a few art pieces for the 
					gallery. The winner of the official competition builds was Shylilie, who participated in every aspect of the competition and presented an 
					incredibly detailed rendition of one of her childhood homes. The winner of the free builds was MCG8, who built numerous homes and won for 
					imagination in her 'Dream Home'. Participants are awarded prize packages including real estate/fair rides in the forthcoming Funland Theme Park, 
					next to Tsai Group headquarters, north of Ghibli Port.

				<p class="heading">Featured Build: Bank of Gavel Western Headquarters</p>
				<p>
					After a long time deciding what build to add to Delve City, thursiya chose to add a branch of the prolific Bank of Gavel. Being as Delve City is 
					quite significant, this bank was chosen to be not only a regional banking branch but also the western headquarters of the Bank of Gavel, 
					overseeing all Bank of Gavel operations west of Gavel. The bank building is loosely based on the original hunting lodge of Versailles, with the 
					main floor of the north wing housing the Delve City Regional Bank Branch, and the main floor of the south wing housing an investment and loans 
					office (currently the only financial location offering deposits of additional precious materials or construction loans). Inside the main 
					headquarters are various offices, including a governor's suite on the top floor, and a number of storage vaults. The most significant vault is 
					the Main Vault, located on the bottom floor, locked with a redstone password system - the first of its kind. Make sure to check out the 
					governor's suite, gardens and helipad in the back, the map of Bank of Gavel branches, and try to figure out the vault password hidden in a clue 
					somewhere in the building. The Bank of Gavel Western Headquarters can be reached by road in the western suburb of Delve City or soon by 
					helicopter from the Delve Airport.
