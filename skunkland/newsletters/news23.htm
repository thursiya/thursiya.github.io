		Crevasse City, Crevatia - The chaos engulfing the cities of Crevatia is subsiding as the last 
		vestiges of resistance are being put down by military enforcers.  Just days ago Crevasse was 
		the bustling centre of a peaceful dominion and now ubiquitous guards and the banners of the 
		new military regime herald it as capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Crevatia.  
		Little but title has changed in the territories outside the heartland - for the moment.  
		Rumours abound that there may be high ranking members of the old regime holed up in the Gavel 
		embassy.

		Busy players are building and expanding borders - remember that a new political map is coming 
		out with the next newsletter so send in your updates to be included.  After waiting so long 
		for 1.9 we have the shortest update wait ever and 1.10 is already here!  There are not a lot 
		of new features but the new magma blocks that "absorb" light levels stand out and the 
		(potentially annoying) auto-jump feature will catch your attention immediately:<br>
		- auto-jump feature like in pocket edition (turned on by default and adjustable in control 
		settings)<br>
		- <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fossil">fossils</a> (generated underground in new 
		swamps and desert)<br>
		- <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bone_Block">bone blocks</a> (craftable from bone 
		meal and found in fossils)<br>
		- <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Polar_Bear">polar bears</a><br>
		- new mob variants: <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Zombie#Husks">Husks</a> (most 
		zombies in desert) and <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Skeleton#Stray">Strays</a> 
		(most skeletons in ice biomes)<br>
		- new nether blocks: <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Magma_Block">magma block</a>, 
		<a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Nether_Wart_Block">nether wart block</a>,

		The newest thing players will find on the server is a sleep script that changes night to day 
		when only one person is sleeping.  This script is possible because of the implementation of 
		command blocks which has also made possible the new Skunkland economy (explained below).  
		Thursiya split time between implementing the new economy with new bank branches (Bank of 
		Gavel Crevasse at the Crevasse Mall, Bank of Gavel Patria at Red Rose Mall) and working on 
		the Doggy Magical department store at Red Rose Mall.  The Red Rose Mall project is now 
		complete and Shylilie has moved on to other builds in Patria, opening "The Block" stores, 
		and upgrading Skaald Fortress while SpaceSkunks has nearly completed an airport at Delve.  
		SpaceSkunks also fit in building a private residence in Northside New Kingsburg with a rare 
		book store in it and continues to slowly add to the librarians populating the Hall of 
		Knowledge.  Yrsyrs has been caught up in the Crevatian revolution, refitting towns, 
		rebuilding Home Tree into a giant tree ideal for launching in elytra from, and adding some 
		small touches like changing the Crevasse Mall's midday chime to "Ode to Joy".  Dropkickz has 
		officially taken over the abandoned builds next to Tree Tower and started upgrading the rail 
		connections from Tree Tower to the builds in the Far East.  Tree Tower has been connected to 
		the subway route, first by the south route from Porcinia, and now by the east route from 
		Moon Base with a stop-over at Cutter's Junction.  The east exit of Tree Tower connects to 
		the above/below ground rail network that stretches to the Far East.

	<p><b><i>New Feature: Server Economy</i></b></p>
	<p>
		With the activation of command blocks on the server also came a desire to add our own server 
		economy.  Thursiya put in a lot of work in April into creating that economy system and 
		making sure the entire thing runs on signs - yes, signs, which you may not have realised are 
		clickable (because they previously didn't do anything).  Signs associated with the server 
		economy have coloured text and will do things when you right-click on them.  Players can 
		click the appropriate signs to stock items for sale, buy items from a player, and get paid 
		for their successful sales.  The system requires an active banking system as well that is 
		now in place at all bank branches.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are currently three currencies traded in the Skunkland economy: Dollars ($), Veridian 
		(&#10183;), and Denarii (&#x110;).  You can acquire currency by visiting a bank, depositing 
		emeralds, then buying the appropriate currency with your deposited emeralds.  Dollars trade 
		at 10/emerald, Veridian 64/emerald, and Denarii 16/emerald.  Players who have the 
		appropriate currency can buy items advertised in green text on signs.  You can check how 
		much money you have on your "bank card" by clicking on ATM or bank signs.  Most economy 
		signs will not do anything if you don't have sufficient funds, there are no items for sale, 
		etc.  To find out more about the economy in game you can read the book "Banking Guide" 
		found in any ATM.  If you'd like to start selling something just inform thursiya of what, 
		where, how much, and what currency, and signs will be prepared for you.

	<p><b><i>Featured Build: Cirrus</i></b></p>
	<p>
		Long ago Shylilie went searching for a jungle biome, venturing far to the west of Faclair to 
		no avail.  So Shylilie decided to "make" a jungle biome in Faclair by importing massive 
		amounts of jungle saplings and planting the largest artificial forest in Skunkland.  In the 
		midst of this jungle and along its tour route a settlement was founded high in the treetops, 
		Cirrus.  Most of the buildings in Cirrus are accessible along the Jungle Tours route by 
		climbing the vines and trunk that sit next to the elevated road and then accessing platforms, 
		homes, and businesses high up in the canopy.  Multiple guest cabins and sky huts can be found 
		in the southeast, near Auverland, at the Swinging Vine Hotel.  Shopping opportunities are 
		currently concentrated in the northwest at the Ocelot Sky Mart.  Make sure you check out 
		Black Sky Manor, the giant project in progress in the northeast, and find the games room at 
		the hotel.  Cirrus can be reached by road west of Auverland or Cadwgan, by subway at the 
		Jungle Tours station, or by nether portal.
