				<p><b>April/May 2016</b></p>
				<p class="big heading">*** The New Kingsburg Monitor ***</p>
				<blockquote>
					Crevasse City, Crevatia - The chaos engulfing the cities of Crevatia is subsiding as the last vestiges of resistance are being put down 
					by military enforcers. Just days ago Crevasse was the bustling centre of a peaceful dominion, now ubiquitous guards and the banners of 
					the new military regime herald it as capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Crevatia. Little but title has changed in the 
					territories outside the heartland - for the moment. Rumours abound that there may be high ranking members of the old regime holed up in 
					the Gavel embassy.

					Busy players are building and expanding borders - remember that a new political map is coming out with the next newsletter, so send in 
					your updates to be included. After waiting so long for 1.9 we have the shortest update wait ever, and 1.10 is already here! There are 
					not a lot of new features, but the new magma blocks that "absorb" light levels stand out, and the (potentially annoying) auto-jump 
					feature will catch your attention immediately:<br>
					- auto-jump feature like in pocket edition (turned on by default and adjustable in control settings)<br>
					- <script>wiki("fossils")</script> (generated underground in new swamps and desert)<br>
					- <script>wiki("bone blocks")</script> (craftable from bone meal and found in fossils)<br>
					- <script>wiki("polar bears")</script><br>
					- new mob variants: <script>wiki("Husks")</script> (most zombies in desert) and <script>wiki("Strays")</script> (most skeletons in ice biomes)<br>
					- new nether blocks: <script>wiki("magma block")</script>, <script>wiki("nether wart block")</script>, <script>wiki("red nether brick")</script><br>
				</p>
				<p>
					The newest thing players will find on the server is a sleep script that changes night to day when only one person is sleeping. This script 
					is possible because of the implementation of command blocks, which has also made possible the new Skunkland economy (explained below). Thursiya 
					split time between implementing the new economy with new bank branches (Bank of Gavel Crevasse at the Crevasse Mall, Bank of Gavel Patria at 
					Red Rose Mall) and working on the Doggy Magical department store at Red Rose Mall. The Red Rose Mall project is now complete, and Shylilie has 
					moved on to other builds in Patria, opening "The Block" stores, and upgrading Skaald Fortress. Meanwhile, SpaceSkunks has nearly completed an 
					airport at Delve. Spaceskunks also fit in building a private residence in Northside New Kingsburg with a rare book store in it and continues to 
					slowly add to the librarians populating the Hall of Knowledge. Yrsyrs has been caught up in the Crevatian revolution, refitting towns, 
					rebuilding Home Tree into a giant tree ideal for launching in elytra from, and adding some small touches like changing the Crevasse Mall's 
					midday chime to "Ode to Joy". Dropkickz has officially taken over the abandoned builds next to Tree Tower and started upgrading the rail 
					connections from Tree Tower to the builds in the Far East. Tree Tower has been connected to the subway route, first by the south route from 
					Porcinia, and now by the east route from Moon Base with a stop-over at Cutter's Junction. The east exit of Tree Tower connects to the 
					above/below ground rail network that stretches to the Far East.

					Some of the latest sights in Skunkland. Top to bottom, left to right: The Hall of Knowledge (Azuriel Palace, Delve City); Tseles Bank of

					Rose Mall and park (Auverland); Red Rose Mall Food Court; Reservoir (outside Imperial City, Badrum).

				<p class="heading">New Feature: Server Economy</p>
				<p>
					With the activation of command blocks on the server also came a desire to add our own server economy. Thursiya put a lot of work in April into 
					creating that economy system and making sure the entire thing runs on signs - yes, signs, which you may not have realised are clickable (because 
					they previously didn't do anything). Signs associated with the server economy have coloured text and will do things when you right-click on 
					them. Players can click the appropriate signs to stock items for sale, buy items from a player, and get paid for their successful sales. The 
					system requires an active banking system as well that is now in place at all bank branches.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are currently three currencies traded in the Skunkland economy: Dollars ($), Veridian (&#10183;), and Denarii (&#x110;). You can acquire 
					currency by visiting a bank, depositing emeralds, then buying the appropriate currency with your deposited emeralds. Dollars trade at 10/emerald, 
					Veridian 64/emerald, and Denarii 16/emerald. Players who have the appropriate currency can buy items advertised in green text on signs. You can 
					check how much money you have on your "bank card" by clicking on ATM or bank signs. Most economy signs will not do anything if you don't have 
					sufficient funds, there are no items for sale, etc. To find out more about the economy in game, you can read the book "Banking Guide" found in 
					any ATM. If you'd like to start selling something, just inform thursiya of what, where, how much, and what currency, and signs will be prepared for you.

				<p class="heading">Featured Build: Cirrus</p>
				<p>
					Long ago Shylilie went searching for a jungle biome, venturing far to the west of Faclair to no avail. So Shylilie decided to "make" a jungle 
					biome in Faclair by importing massive amounts of jungle saplings and planting the largest artificial forest in Skunkland. In the midst of this 
					jungle and along its tour route, a settlement was founded high in the treetops, Cirrus. Most of the buildings in Cirrus are accessible along 
					the Jungle Tours route by climbing the vines and trunk that sit next to the elevated road and then accessing platforms, homes, and businesses 
					high up in the canopy. Multiple guest cabins and sky huts can be found in the southeast, near Auverland, at the Swinging Vine Hotel. Shopping 
					opportunities are currently concentrated in the northwest at the Ocelot Sky Mart. Make sure you check out Black Sky Manor, the giant project 
					in progress in the northeast, and find the games room at the hotel. Cirrus can be reached by road west of Auverland or Cadwgan, by subway at 
					the Jungle Tours station, or by nether portal.
