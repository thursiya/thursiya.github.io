				<p class="big"><b><i>*** The New Kingsburg Monitor ***</i></b></p>
				<blockquote><i>
					New Kingsburg, Pristina - "Citizens flock to the Pristina State Courthouse to see its first case of corporate law: 
					Thurail Corporation is suing Thrurail Corporation for trademark infringement. Thurail Corporation, temporarily based 
					out of New Kingsburg until headquarters are completed in Celestia, was founded shortly after the server was started 
					and has worked to link the great population centers of Skunkland. Thrurail Corporation, a Crevatian Dominion 
					state-owned corporation, is the newcomer cutting long distance subway connections across the Crevatian Dominion. The 
					two corporations have competing visions for the global subway network, but so far their feud has not disrupted 
					travel. We can only hope that a settlement will work out in the favour of commuters."

					We are currently on version 1.4.6, which was a special update rushed to be on time for New Years. Most of the changes 
					between the Pretty Scary Update and this one have been to deal with bugs, so most bugs seem to be resolved now. There 
					are some important new blocks/items to be aware of:<br>
					- <script>wiki("fireworks")</script>!<br>
					- <script>wiki("enchanted books")</script> (for adding specific enchantments to items)<br>
					- <script>wiki("nether brick slabs")</script> (finally)<br>
					- thorns enchantment and some enchantment modifications
				</p>
				<p>
					For a complete list of changes in this and previous updates see <script>wiki("Java Edition version history")</script>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since our last update things have been going ahead full steam in Southshore, the fastest growing city on the server and 
					now the hub of the newly formed Commune of Southshore. Major work continues in Enlil Province on the Persson 
					International Airport. Check out Koku's Village for some important changes and Hometree for a holiday surprise. The 
					subway network has now extended to the Baths Palace (Masovia State), Southshore, West Koku, Anderson's Crossing, and a 
					special station has been setup at Spawn. Yrsyrs has successfully developed a method for shipping villagers along the 
					subway network to allow for easy populating of your towns - contact him to get your first pioneers sent in!

					For this double-month, year-end wrap-up issue we are featuring "The Bridges of Skunkland", a look at some of the finest 
					bridges throughout the server. From left to right, top to bottom: Crescent Diadem Bridge (Moon River, north of the

				<p><b><i>Important Server Change Notice and End of the Year Celebration</i></b></p>
				<p>
					Starting in January, the server is going to be hosted from a new site. Until it's up we can't be sure what the address 
					will be, but the current server will only remain up until approximately midnight December 31. Join us at 8 pm on December 
					31 as yrsyrs will be putting on a special New Year's fireworks show taking place in William's Harbour (west of Eweton, 
					north of Desert Town) - head over to one of the south balconies in the apartment building for the best view! There will 
					be another brief message with the new server site as soon as we have it up and running.

				<p><b><i>Featured Build: Koku's Fortress</i></b></p>
				<p>
					This month's featured build is Koku's Fortress by kokushibyou316. The fortress has been under construction since spring of 
					2012. Founded in a steep mountain complex south of Gavel, kokushibyou316 quickly built up a massive curtain wall about the 
					entire thing and began clearing out the enclosed bay to make room for a grand tall ship. Key to the fast construction of 
					the fortress was a mob trap built inside the mountain, which allows players to quickly gain the experience needed for 
					enchantments. In recent months the work space on the west side of the fortress has been transformed into the beginnings of 
					a renaissance village. Players are eager to find out what is planned for the flattened cliff tops of the fortress that 
					command an impressive view of the village. Make sure to check out the fortress' entrance, mob trap, village, and of course 
					the tall ship. Koku's Fortress can be reached by road southeast of New Kingsburg or north of Jonville, or by nether portal. 
					Subway access is through the West Koku station (south of Ghibli Port) with direct fortress access coming soon.
