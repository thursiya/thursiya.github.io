		Lunar Hill, Gavel: A small group of what appear to be protesters have gathered outside of the Operis Lunar 
		Hill office. The group is similar to others that have occasionally sprung up across the country avoiding 
		vigilant big city security forces in favour of smaller communities. The latest concern is the shift to factory 
		farming in Operis operations. Reached for comment, an Operis spokesperson responded, "The market has dictated 
		a need for increased production. We continue to focus on meeting shareholder expectations." This wouldn't be 
		the first commercial controversy here as unfounded rumours persist of slave labour bolstering the economy.

		Well, thanks to the world being on lockdown, Skunkland has been busier than ever. We continue in version 
		1.15.2 for the time being, awaiting the next big update that will usher in nether biomes and a number of 
		new blocks.

		Since the end of the Century Build contest our players have headed back to familiar territory and begun 
		aggressively tackling long overdue projects. We've also seen the return of SpaceNerds, now with a username 
		shift to Keirclarkson. SpaceSkunks has shifted operations south to the mega project in Alaris, preparing for 
		this year's Skyscrapers competition. New builds include the Iron Spire, Star of Alaris complex, and Hansen's 
		Honey Farm, as well as a Steiner's Arms location in Auverland and new custom items for sale at all 3 locations. 
		Shylilie has finally furnished Hastings Apartments, built the Wynyerd Pub in Leawood, and outfitted a new The 
		Block location built by MCG8 (currently PoppyPants1010) in the Far East. Together with thursiya they have added 
		a number of stores to the Auverland Subway Station. Thursiya completed the entrance to Funland, added music to 
		the roller coaster, and built the Marina Centre in Southside, New Kingsburg to finally house The Block. The 
		Crevasse Mall has been undergoing repairs and upgrades including a new Happy Little Accidents location, fixes 
		to Star Mart, and 2 shops joining the economy so now players can spend some of that Denarii! Keirclarkson 
		settled in a little hidden valley north of Sedona and has been slowly building a quaint settlement. The economy 
		signs and functions have been completely rewritten to improve legibility, standardization, and ease of price 
		changing. After the Tortilla Flat subway connection was completed new heli-flight destinations from Persson 
		Airport opened to Mellon Bay, Ghibli Port, and Zefram.

	<p><b><i>Skyscrapers of Skunkland</i></b></p>
	<p>
		Our second Skyscrapers of Skunkland contest has come and gone and we had an extra participant this year. 
		Players built embassies in the Gavel capital of Nexus that were in the theme of "Patriotic Pride" (while 
		thursiya constructed the administration centre of the republic: the Nexus Orb). This was the first foray 
		onto the international stage for new state Sedona, an offshoot of Braille. Spaceskunks' intricately-detailed 
		Ennist embassy was declared the winner and it is believed that this year's competition will be held in Alaris.

	<p><b><i>Century Build</i></b></p>
	<p>
		In two weeks time we will officially begin the Year 600 Century Build! Year 600 begins February 26, 2020 and 
		goes until March 2, 2020. This year's theme is "Builders in Motion" and we will be building various contraptions 
		for moving around at the Funland site (abandoned amusement park no more!). Players will add a segment to the 
		Funland Coaster wrapping around the park, create their own ride (that must physically move a player), and have 
		access to an area for constructing their own creative builds. To reach Funland take the road or subway east from 
		the New Kingsburg airport or the road or subway north from Ghibli Port. At the end of the competition prizes will 
		be awarded by Thurail Corporation to all participants and a special prize to the builder of the most original 
		ride. It's time to get loud, it's time to get colourful, it's time to get moving because we're going to the fair!
