		Advertisement: A wide coastline looking to a mighty fortress, rolling desert, snow-capped hills, and unspoiled 
		forests. These are just some of the vistas you can experience in Ghibli, Gavel's southernmost province. Come 
		enjoy life away from the urban sprawl and see some of the original communities of Skunkland and the wildest 
		people in Gavel. Ghibli is for fun-lovers!

		In the short space of time since our last newsletter update 1.15 ("Buzzy Bees") has been released and we are 
		currently running version 1.15.2. Here are the few new things possible with 1.15:<br>
		- bees (obviously) and honey-collecting mechanics<br>
		- bee nests & beehives<br>
		- honey bottles, honey blocks (slow vertical movement), and honeycomb blocks
	</p>

		Over the last couple months we have mostly been focused on the Skyscrapers of Skunkland build. Thursiya 
		worked for a long time to get the Nexus subway station and build site ready. Since the end of the competition 
		Spaceskunks has been adding to Ulve, Shylilie is busy creating her new territory of Orne, and thursiya is 
		digging the subway from Bright Farm to Tortilla Flat. Also of note, our preferred mapping software has finally 
		been updated to handle the current world format so updated maps are coming back!

		Our second Skyscrapers of Skunkland contest has come and gone and we had an extra participant this year. 
		Players built embassies in the Gavel capital of Nexus that were in the theme of "Patriotic Pride" (while 
		thursiya constructed the administration centre of the republic: the Nexus Orb). This was the first foray 
		onto the international stage for new state Sedona, an offshoot of Braille. Spaceskunks' intricately-detailed 
		Ennist embassy was declared the winner and it is believed that this year's competition will be held in Alaris.

	<p><b><i>Century Build</i></b></p>
	<p>
		In two weeks time we will officially begin the Year 600 Century Build! Year 600 begins February 26, 2020 and 
		goes until March 2, 2020. This year's theme is "Builders in Motion" and we will be building various contraptions 
		for moving around at the Funland site (abandoned amusement park no more!). Players will add a segment to the 
		Funland Coaster wrapping around the park, create their own ride (that must physically move a player), and have 
		access to an area for constructing their own creative builds. To reach Funland take the road or subway east from 
		the New Kingsburg airport or the road or subway north from Ghibli Port. At the end of the competition prizes will 
		be awarded by Thurail Corporation to all participants and a special prize to the builder of the most original 
		ride. It's time to get loud, it's time to get colourful, it's time to get moving because we're going to the fair!
