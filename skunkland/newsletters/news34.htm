					Advertisement: A wide coastline looking to a mighty fortress, rolling desert, snow-capped hills, and unspoiled forests. These are just some 
					of the vistas you can experience in Ghibli, Gavel's southernmost province. Come enjoy life away from the urban sprawl and see some of the 
					original communities of Skunkland and the wildest people in Gavel. Ghibli is for fun-lovers!

					In the short space of time since our last newsletter update 1.15 ("Buzzy Bees") has been released, and we are currently running version 
					1.15.2. Here are the few new things possible with 1.15:<br>
					- <script>wiki("bees")</script> (obviously) and honey-collecting mechanics<br>
					- <script>wiki("bee nests")</script> & <script>wiki("beehives")</script><br>
					- <script>wiki("honey bottles")</script>, <script>wiki("honey blocks")</script> (slow vertical movement), and <script>wiki("honeycomb blocks")</script>
				</p>

					Over the last couple months, we have mostly been focused on the Skyscrapers of Skunkland build. Thursiya worked for a long time to get the 
					Nexus subway station and build site ready. Since the end of the competition, Spaceskunks has been adding to Ulve, Shylilie is busy creating 
					her new territory of Orne, and thursiya is digging the subway from Bright Farm to Tortilla Flat. Also of note, our preferred mapping software 
					has finally been updated to handle the current world format so updated maps are coming back!

				<p class="heading">Skyscrapers of Skunkland</p>
				<p>
					Our second Skyscrapers of Skunkland contest has come and gone, and we had an extra participant this year. Players built embassies in the Gavel 
					capital of Nexus that were in the theme of "Patriotic Pride" (while thursiya constructed the administration centre of the republic: the Nexus 
					Orb). This was the first foray onto the international stage for new state Sedona, an offshoot of Braille. Spaceskunks' intricately-detailed 
					Ennist embassy was declared the winner, and it is believed that this year's competition will be held in Alaris.

				<p class="heading">Century Build</p>
				<p>
					In two weeks time we will officially begin the Year 600 Century Build! Year 600 begins February 26, 2020 and goes until March 2, 2020. This 
					year's theme is "Builders in Motion", and we will be building various contraptions for moving around at the Funland site (abandoned amusement 
					park no more!). Players will add a segment to the Funland Coaster wrapping around the park, create their own ride (that must physically move a 
					player), and have access to an area for constructing their own creative builds. To reach Funland take the road or subway east from the New 
					Kingsburg airport or the road or subway north from Ghibli Port. At the end of the competition, prizes will be awarded by Thurail Corporation to 
					all participants, and a special prize to the builder of the most original ride. It's time to get loud, it's time to get colourful, it's time to 
					get moving, because we're going to the fair!
