					The Skunkland server was founded in December 2011. It is a vanilla survival server, so 
					no mods, PvP, or creative builds; everything was made the good old-fashioned way, 
					block-by-mined-block while avoiding creepers! The server is whitelisted to prevent 
					griefing and theft. If you know someone who'd like to join the server please make sure 
					they are at least 13 years old and get them to read through and understand these rules 
					then contact the server	admin, thursiya.
				</p>
				
				<div class="contentheader round">Rules</div>
				<p class="big"><b>Thou Shalt Not Grief or Steal</b></p>
				<p>
					We choose to play on a white-listed server for a reason: we want to build in peace and be 
					able to return to our creations in the same state we left them. Simply put, don't modify 
					another player's build or take items that are not yours or given to you. We have been 
					fortunate not to have to worry about these problems on our server and hope to stay that way.
				</p>
				<p>
					As part of our peaceful co-existance, our server also has no PvP. Players are unable to 
					damage each other. Players may choose to build traps or dangerous locations but we ask that 
					players do not falsely advertise safety in their builds. One way you can watch out for 
					others is by properly lighting your build so visitors don't have to worry about mobs 
					(<i>see <a href="../tools/lighting.htm" target="_blank">Lighting Basics</a></i>).
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="big"><b>Thou Shalt Replant</b></p>
				<p>
					On our server we like to maintain the world in a fairly natural state. Admins remove world 
					generation errors like floating blocks/islands and clean up trim edges as part of 
					maintenance. As a player traveling around the greater server world you are expected to leave 
					the world in the state you found it. That means replanting trees, sugar cane, and cacti that 
					you harvest (and that you harvest fully). It also means repairing creeper damage you cause 
					(or getting admin help if not possible).
				</p>
				<p>
					Obviously the world is changed when players choose to build in an area, so these rules are 
					meant for maintaining areas of the world beyond builds.
				</p>

				<p>
					<i>Note: We are currently using a single player sleep algorithm that sets the world to day 
					if only one player sleeps.</i> The players can skip the night phase if all players logged into 
					the server are in beds at the same time. To inform other players that you wish to skip the night 
					phase send the chat 'zzz' when you are in bed. If another player has indicated that they wish to 
					sleep you should find a bed to sleep in (and type 'zzz' to show you are in bed) or log out if a 
					bed is not nearby.
				</p>
				<p>
					Much of the world of Skunkland is connected by a network of subways. Inside each subway station 
					is a chest (or dispenser) containing minecarts for visitors to use.  If you need to borrow a 
					minecart try to replace it later to keep the lending system working.
				</p>
				
				<div class="contentheader round" id="Abandoned Builds">Notes on Abandoned Builds</div>
				<p>
					Occasionally players choose to give up on their builds in Skunkland and (hopefully) inform the 
					admin that their build sites are abandoned. You can find abandoned builds on the political map 
					marked with a light grey outline or ask the server admin if a site is abandoned (few are).
				</p>
				<p>
					Abandoned builds are open to other players to build in and claim <i><b>provided that any build 
					that was already completed at the site be maintained</b></i>. This could mean building around 
					it or adding to it as part of a revitalization project. Structures built for the express 
					purpose of survival/playing the game/aquiring resources (such as survival shacks, strip mines, 
					animal pens, vegetable gardens, tree farms, etc.) may be removed or altered. Usually you can 
					identify a build to be maintained by the presence of signs or purely aesthetic markings. If it 
					is at all unclear what must be maintained at an abandoned build then contact the admin. 
					Assuming the new builder is willing to keep these things in mind then that player is free to 
					build at the site, claim the land, and any goods left behind in chests, etc. Abandonded builds 
					are <b>not</b> free game for looting.
