					Light is one of the central mechanics of Minecraft. The light value on a block can be from 0 
					to 15. The most basic source of light is the sun. Blocks exposed to sunlight (the sky is 
					directly above them) will be at light level 15 during the majority of the day. As the day ends 
					the sunlight level will drop until it is dark and these blocks have a light level of 0. As the 
					new day dawns the light level will return to 15. This is the natural light cycle. During 
					weather events the light level drops and will even fall below level 8 during a thunderstorm.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any solid block that has a light level below 8 could potentially spawn a hostile mob (see below). 
					This drives us to add crafted lighting to keep our builds at or above light level 8 regardless of 
					the time of day. The most common light source is the torch. Torches light the block they are in 
					to a value of 14 then drop off by 1 for each block from the source (see diagram). The light 
					thrown by a torch is the same regardless of its orientation (standing up/attached to the side of 
					a block). Block light sources (redstone lamp, glowstone, jack o'lantern) fill their entire block 
					and throw light one block farther than torches (i.e. adjacent blocks start at level 14). You can 
					measure the light level of the block you are standing on by loading the debug screen (F3) and 
					looking for the 'Light' value. The number after tells you the current light level (often 15 
					outside during the day) and then a 'sky' and 'block' value are given (with the current light 
					level always the highest of the two). The 'block' light is how much light your block will have 
					regardless of the weather or time of day - it's the minimum light level. Note that light is 
					listed as 0 for sky and block when you are standing on a half-slab (which cannot spawn mobs anyhow).
				</p>
				<p>
					Less common light sources include fire, lava, redstone torches, redstone ore blocks, redstone 
					repeaters, operating furnaces, and nether portals. Fire and lava both produce light at the same 
					level as the block light sources (and lava produces the same light level regardless of volume). 
					Redstone torches, glowing redstone ore blocks, and redstone repeaters produce light but not 
					significant amounts. A lit repeater produces a light level of 9 in its own block, but otherwise 
					they all do not produce enough light to raise the light level above 7. Be careful - lit redstone 
					wiring and redstone blocks do not actually emit any light. Furnaces produce nearly as much light 
					as a torch when they are in operation (regardless of which side you are facing). Nether portals 
					also give off enough light to keep a few blocks around them mob free (but not their tops!).

				<div class="contentheader round">Preventing Hostile Mob Spawning</div>
				<p>
					<img src="https://minecraft.wiki/images/Mob_spawning_ranges.png" alt="Mob Spawning Ranges" height="300" style="float:right; margin:10px">
					When the light level drops below 8, or in locations where it already is below 8 (such as caves), 
					players	need to worry about hostile mobs spawning. Monsters can spawn on top of any dark block 
					within a certain range of the player (as long as there is headroom for them). Mobs will not 
					spawn within 16m of the player or outside of loaded chunks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Monsters can only spawn on top of solid blocks. This means the block must have a solid top, 
					such as on a block of dirt, sand, or stone. This includes the tops of upside-down stairs and 
					slabs. Mobs will not spawn on top of transparent or partially transparent blocks, including 
					air (obviously), leaves, glass, fences, tops of upright stairs, and slabs. They will also not 
					spawn in or on top of lava, water, or bedrock.
				</p>
				<p style="clear:both">
					<img src="images/Staggered Torches.png" alt="Efficient Staggered Torches" height="290" style="float:left;margin:10px">
					This means that most of the natural world is not safe at night (outside of tree tops and water). 
					It also means that most players' builds are not safe unless properly lit with torches or lamps. 
					If you are working in a large flat area and want to efficiently place torches to avoid hostile 
					mob spawning then you need to consider the torch ranges (given above). A good repeating pattern 
					is to place torches with 11m between them, then stagger the next row of torches 6m to the right 
					and 7m up (see example).
				</p>
				<p>
					One key area that players run into lighting problems is with the roofs of structures. Just like
					the ground level, roofs need to be built in a certain way or lit properly to avoid mobs dropping 
					in. This has led to the popularity of the staircase roof.  Because stairs are not solid blocks 
					they are safe from mob spawning and they make a lovely 45 degree angled roof, plus they come in 
					many block varieties. It is also safe to use glass blocks in roofs.Be careful of building roofs 
					with slabs. Although slabs in their standard form are safe from mob spawning, when you build an 
					upside-down slab (one that is level with full-sized blocks on the top) then it functions just 
					like a normal block on its top and can spawn mobs. Carpeting now prevents mob spawning and can 
					be used to make individual solid block tops safe.
