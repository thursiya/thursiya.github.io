					If you're looking for a little more modern way of ascending your build try this simple elevator 
					system. The shaft is only 1m by 1m and it requires no redstone wiring plus it functions for 
					any number of standard 4m high floors and it's super quick! You will need 1 minecart, 1 
					ladder, 1 door, and 1 pressure plate per floor (aside from the ground level). The ground floor 
					is simple because it requires nothing, only access to the elevator shaft. For each subsequent 
					floor you will need to place a ladder against a block in the shaft level with the floor you're 
					standing on, then a dirt block above the ladder and a rail on top of the dirt. Place a 
					minecart on the rail then destroy the dirt block - this will drop the dirt block and the rail and 
					the minecart will sink gently down to rest on the ladder. Now turn away from the minecart and 
					place your door - this way the back of the door is flush with the minecart and it won't float 
					off of its spot. Above your door you need to place a ceiling slab or leave the space open to 
					allow for the minimum 2.5m clearance required for dismounting (unless you are not fully 
					enclosing your 1x1 elevator shaft then you will be able to exit at the diagonals). <i><b>EDIT: 
					As of 1.8 you now need a minimum of 2.8m clearance to dismount so ceiling slabs now block 
					exiting. Ceiling slabs can be replaced with ceiling trapdoors (which also take signs/item 
					frames).</b></i> You can place a sign or picture frame with a ladder in it on the slab to 
					visually cover up the empty shaft space and simultaneously mark an elevator entrance. Placing a 
					pressure plate in front of the elevator door allows for easy access. See the diagram for a side 
					view of the design. Note that if your minecarts are more than 4m apart, they aren't sitting at 
					floor level, or you don't leave exit clearance then your elevator will not work.
				</p>
				<p>
					Through testing in single player I have determined the method that minecarts choose an exit 
					space and it <b>is relevant to orientation</b>. When exiting the minecart from a simple elevator 
					shaft the exit chosen will be in this order: Northwest corner, North, Northeast, West, East. If 
					all five of those potential exits do not have at least 2.5m clearance then you will exit to the 
					minecart itself. This means that <b>elevators with entrances that face south will not work</b> 
					properly because all of the potential exits will normally be covered up. Be careful to consider 
					this "north side exit strategy" when placing an elevator.
				</p>
				<p>
					This elevator takes advantage of a quirk of minecarts that lets you teleport a short distance 
					when entering a minecart and the fact that dismounting moves you away from the minecart. While 
					sitting in a minecart you can right-click the minecart above you to teleport to it, as long as 
					the next minecart up is no more than 4m away (3 blocks in between the two). To ascend the 
					elevator step into the shaft at ground floor or right-click the minecart behind the door on 
					another floor then look up and hold right-click until you reach your desired floor. Leave the 
					elevator by pressing SHIFT. To descend simply walk directly into the minecart and you will 
					fall (safely) through the shaft until you reach the bottom (or you can right-click a minecart 
					to stop prematurely).
