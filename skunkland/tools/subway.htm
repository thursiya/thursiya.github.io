					The subway system in Skunkland is at level 55 so the lower level schematic is at elevation 55. 
					The upper level schematic is at level 58. Rails with a green background are one level up (so 
					level 56 in the lower schematic). Rails with a red background are one level down (so level 57 
					in the upper schematic). The wooden planks that make up the boarding area in the upper 
					schematic are at level 59 (and the rails over them). Don't forget the redstone dust and 
					activator buttons above the boarding area. Each station's boarding area also comes with a 
					chest containing at least 2 minecarts. Make sure that the powered rail in the boarding area is 
					<b>not</b> powered (so that it brakes the arriving minecart). The two schematics show standard 
					placement for torches and the upper schematic shows placement for the three switches.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is critical that the station is built in the correct orientation (these schematics are 
					oriented to the north) because of the <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/South-east_rule">SE 
					Rule</a> in Minecraft. Essentially the rule means that when a minecart rolls onto a section of 
					track perpendicular to it (i.e. hits a 'T') it will automatically go South (if it's a North-South 
					track) or East (if it's a West-East track).

					This schematic changes the old subway slightly by moving the North access line 3m West (to line 
					it up with the South access line) and the East access line 2m South (to line it up with the 
					West access line) and the redirect loop only travels 1m (instead of 2m) West now. The West and 
					South access lines remain unchanged. Note the N-S alignment of the rail that the West and East 
					accesses roll into; if it is allowed to curve one of the access routes will not work.
				</p>
				<p>
					The compact upper section also shows a simplified switching system if you intend to only use 
					two switches (true binary) instead of the standard 3. This method requires some redstone dust 
					to allow the right switch to control both track intersections.
